# How It Works

Notables are the latest Pepe collection, launched on the Ethereum blockchain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some of the parameters in this document are hardcoded into the collection, but others may evolve as the collection progresses.
{% endhint %}

[Rare Pepe](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/), [Fake Rare](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rare-artists.md) and Ethereum artists will be the first to produce Pepe cards to be distributed under the Notables collection, before submissions are open to all artists in traditional Pepe fashion (with submission rules and scientists overseeing dankness).&#x20;

Each **Sunday at 4:20 PM EST**, 5 new cards will be released, with supplies between 100 and 1,000 units. All cards will sell for the same price of 0.069 ETH.&#x20;

There are allowlists for both creators and collectors to give them access to submitting or acquiring art. Whitelisting will be managed through two NFTs that act as keys to each process: Pepe Checks for collectors and Pepe Cheques for artists.

{% hint style="info" %}
**TL;DR:**

* [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) will act as an access pass for [Notable Pepes](https://twitter.com/notablepepes). Each access pass represents a raffle ticket for each mint's allowlist.
* 50 cards per Notable Pepes series
* Pepe Checks serves as Card 1 of Series 1.
* Series 1 cards price = 0.069 ETH
* Supply = 100 to 1000 per card
* One wallet can win multiple AL spots for each mint
{% endhint %}

## THE COLLECTORâ€™S JOURNEY

The Notables collection will drop 5 cards every week in a two-phased process where only whitelisted addresses will be able to collect cards. The [Pepe Inc.](../pepe-inc..md) will conduct a lottery to assign allowlist spots for each of the 5 cards, based on the ownership of Pepe Checks (which is also considered Card 1 of the Series 1 of the [Notables](https://pepe.wtf/collection/Notable-Pepes) collection).

### PHASE 1 - TIER 1 ACCESS

* 100% of the card supply will be open for sale in this phase
* There will be an allowlist consisting of a number of spots equal to 1.5 times the card units for sale.
* The spots will be assigned through a lottery between the 237,869 Pepe Checks (snapshot is taken every Saturday).
* One single address / owner can win more than one spot in the allowlist, depending on how many winning Pepe Checks they own.&#x20;

### PHASE 2 - TIER 2 ACCESS

* If there is no sellout in Phase1, then Phase2 will become available
* There will be an allowlist consisting of a number of spots equal to 5 times the card units for sale.
* The spots will be assigned through a lottery between the 237,869 Pepe Checks (snapshot is taken every Saturday). Phase 1 winners are excluded from this lottery.
* Each winning Pepe Checks gives its owner the right to purchase one unit of a card.
* Once Phase2 is open, collectors will be able to purchase on a first-come first-serve basis.
* Any unsold units from Phase1 are put up for sale in Phase2.

## THE ARTIST JOURNEY

The [Fake Rare submission rules](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rares-submission-rules.md) will be in place for the Notables collection too. Series 1 will be mostly Rare Pepe and Fake Rare artists, with some curated artists from Ethereum. Overtime, submissions will be open to any artist through a submission portal on [Pepe.wtf](https://pepe.wtf), and will be checked by a dedicated team of Pepe scientists to ensure dankness. Once a submission is accepted, a Pepe Cheque will be required to be burnt to have the art entered into the Notable Pepe directory.

There will be an initial supply of 2,000 Pepe Cheques that will be distributed as follows.

**Pepe Cheques can be acquired in 3 ways:**

1. Any artist will be able to claim a Pepe Check any time by buying and burning a [FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) card on Counterparty (by adding the ETH address in the transaction memo of a FAKEASF destruction). Since there are 1350 FAKEASF in circulation at the time of writing, 1350 of the 2000 Pepe Cheques will be earmarked for this type of claim.
2. There will also be an initial airdrop in two phases:
   1. The first will be to artists who have submitted a Rare Pepe or Fake Rare. Artists need to have connected an Ethereum address to their Counterparty ID on [Pepe.wtf](https://pepe.wtf). The airdrop will be based on a snapshot of registered ETH addresses on **Friday, 17th February at 5PM EST**.
   2. After the Pepe Cheques for artists are allocated, the remaining ones will be distributed randomly to Pepe Checks holders.
3. The final way to acquire a Pepe Cheque is to wait for secondary market on Ethereum.
