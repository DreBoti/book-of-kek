# How It Works

Notables are the latest Pepe collection, launched on the Ethereum blockchain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some of the parameters in this document are hardcoded into the collection, but others may evolve as the collection progresses.
{% endhint %}

[Rare Pepe](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/), [Fake Rare](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rare-artists.md) and Ethereum artists will be the first to produce Pepe cards to be distributed under the Notables collection, before submissions are open to all artists in traditional Pepe fashion (with submission rules and scientists overseeing dankness).&#x20;

Each **Sunday at 4:20 PM EST**, 5 new cards will be released, with supplies between 100 and 1,000 units. All cards will sell for the same price of 0.069ETH.&#x20;

There are allowlists for both creators and collectors to give them access to submitting or acquiring art. Whitelisting will be managed through two NFTs that act as keys to each process: Pepe Checks for collectors and Pepe Cheques for artists.

## THE COLLECTOR’S JOURNEY

The Notables collection will drop 5 cards every week in a two-phased process where only whitelisted addresses will be able to collect cards. The [Pepe Inc.](../pepe-inc..md) will conduct a lottery to assign allowlist spots for each of the 5 cards, based on the ownership of the Pepe Checks NFT (which is also considered Card 1 of the Series 1 of the [Notables](https://pepe.wtf/collection/Notable-Pepes) collection).

### PHASE 1 - TIER 1 ACCESS

* 80% of the card supply will be open for sale in this phase (between 80 and 800 cards)
* There will be an allowlist consisting of a number of spots equal to 1.5 times the card units for sale.
* The spots will be assigned through a lottery between the 200k Pepe Check token IDs (snapshot is taken at 3:00pm EST every Saturday).
* One single address / owner can win more than one spot in the allowlist, depending on the winning Pepe Check token IDs they own.&#x20;
* Once the drop is open, collectors will have 30 minutes to finalize their purchase on a first-come-first-serve basis.

{% hint style="info" %}
EXAMPLE: For a card with a supply of 100, 80 units of a card would be distributed in Phase 1, and the allowlist will consist of 120 spots selected by a lottery between Pepe Check IDs. Each Pepe Check ID gives its holder the right to purchase 1 card for a period of 30’ since the drop opens.
{% endhint %}

### PHASE 2 - TIER 2 ACCESS

* 20% of the supply is assigned to Tier 2 access
* There will be an allowlist consisting of a number of spots equal to 5 times the card units for sale.
* The spots will be assigned through a lottery between the 200k Pepe Check token IDs (snapshot is taken at 3:00pm EST every Saturday). Phase 1 winners are excluded from this lottery.
* Each winning ID gives its owner the right to purchase one unit of a card.
* Once Phase 2 is open, collectors will have to finalize their purchase on a first-come first-serve basis.
* Any unsold units from PHASE 1 are put up for sale in PHASE 2, but their number is not included in the whitelist composition calculations.

{% hint style="info" %}
EXAMPLE For a card with a supply of 100, 20 units of a card would be distributed in Phase 2, and the whitelist would be drawn from a list of 100 Pepe Check IDs. Each Pepe Check ID gives its holder the right to purchase 1 card. If 10 cards remained unsold from Phase 1, they would be available for sale among the collectors included in the allowlist.
{% endhint %}

## THE ARTIST JOURNEY

The [Fake Rare submission rules](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rares-submission-rules.md) will be in place for the Notables collection too. Series 1 will be mostly Rare Pepe and Fake Rare artists, with some curated artists from Ethereum. Overtime, submissions will be open to any artist through a submission portal on [Pepe.wtf](https://pepe.wtf), and will be checked by a dedicated team of Pepe scientists to ensure dankness. Once a submission is accepted, a Pepe Cheque will be required to be burnt to have the art entered into the Notable Pepe directory.

There will be an initial supply of 2,000 Pepe Cheques that will be distributed as follows.

**Pepe Cheques can be acquired in 3 ways:**

1. Any artist will be able to claim a Pepe Check any time by buying and burning a [FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) card on Counterparty (by adding the ETH address in the transaction memo of a FAKEASF destruction). Since there are 1350 FAKEASF in circulation at the time of writing, 1350 of the 2000 Pepe Cheques will be earmarked for this type of claim.
2. There will also be an initial airdrop in two phases:
   1. The first will be to artists who have submitted a Rare Pepe or Fake Rare. Artists need to have connected an Ethereum address to their Counterparty ID on [Pepe.wtf](https://pepe.wtf). The airdrop will be based on a snapshot of registered ETH addresses on **Friday, 17th February at 5PM EST**.
   2. After the Pepe Cheques for artists are allocated, the remaining ones will be distributed randomly to Pepe Checks holders.
3. The final way to acquire a Pepe Cheque is to wait for secondary market on Ethereum.
