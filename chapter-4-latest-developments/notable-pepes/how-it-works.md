# How It Works

Notables are the latest Pepe collection, launched on the Ethereum blockchain.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some of the parameters in this document are hardcoded into the collection, but others may evolve as the collection progresses.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**TL;DR:**

* Each **Sunday at 4:20 PM EST**, 5 new cards will be released
* All [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holdings will act as an access pass for collectors, representing a raffle ticket for each mint's allowlist
* [Pepe Cheques](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Cheques) will act as an access pass for creators to submitting art, which they can do via the [submission portal](https://pepe.wtf/submission) on [pepe.wtf](../pepe.wtf.md)
* 50 cards per Notable Pepes series
* Cards Price = 0.069 ETH (different pricing might apply on cards with higher supply)
* Supply = 100 to 1000 per card
* One wallet can win multiple AL spots for each mint
* AL for each week's drop can be found on [pepe.wtf](../pepe.wtf.md)
* For Series 2, 10% of the available supply from each drop is allocated to a second AL1 raffle for full set [Series 1](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holders
* PNP claims from a given week will end around the time drops for the week wrap up
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Coming soon**: [Pepe.wtf](../pepe.wtf.md) dashboard where you can sign in with an ETH address and see any claims available for you and any drops you are able to mint without needing to search each AL individually.
{% endhint %}

## THE COLLECTORâ€™S JOURNEY

The Notables collection will drop 5 cards every week in a two-phased process where only whitelisted addresses will be able to collect cards. The [Pepe Inc.](../pepe-inc..md) will conduct a lottery to assign allowlist spots for each of the 5 cards, based on the ownership of any [Notable Pepes](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) (as opposed to [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) exclusively).

### PHASE 1 - TIER 1 ACCESS

* 80% of the card's supply will be open for sale in this phase.
* There will be an allowlist consisting of a number of spots equal to 1.3 times the card units for sale.
* The spots will be assigned through a lottery between the 237,869 Pepe Checks, as well as all [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holdings (snapshot is taken every Saturday).
* One single address / owner can win more than one spot in the allowlist, depending on how many winning Pepe Checks and/or [Notable Pepes](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) they own.&#x20;
* For Series 2, we are planning to allocate 10% of the available supply from each drop to a second AL1 raffle for full set Series 1 holders. For example, on a 100 issuance card, 80 supply is available via the drop, which means 8 AL1 spots get raffled amongst the 25-30 full set holders.&#x20;

### PHASE 2 - TIER 2 ACCESS

* If there is no sellout in Phase1, then Phase2 will become available, and any unsold units from Phase1 are put up for sale in Phase2.
* There will be an allowlist consisting of a number of spots equal to 4 times the card units for sale.
* The spots will be assigned through a lottery between the 237,869 Pepe Checks as well as all [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holdings (snapshot is taken every Saturday). Phase 1 winners are excluded from this lottery.
* Each winning Pepe Checks and/or [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) gives its owner the right to purchase one unit of a card.
* Once Phase2 is open, collectors will be able to purchase on a first-come first-serve basis.

## THE ARTIST'S JOURNEY

{% hint style="info" %}
[Rare Pepe](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/), [Fake Rare](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rare-artists.md) and Ethereum artists were the first to produce Pepe cards to be distributed under Series 1 of the Notables collection, before submissions became open to all artists in traditional Pepe fashion (with submission rules and scientists overseeing dankness).
{% endhint %}

The [Fake Rare submission rules](../../chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/fake-rares-and-dank-rares/fake-rares-submission-rules.md) will be in place for the Notables collection. Series 1 were mostly Rare Pepe and Fake Rare artists, with some curated artists from Ethereum.

Overtime, submissions opened to any artist through a [submission portal](https://pepe.wtf/submission) on pepe.wtf, and which are checked by a dedicated team of Pepe scientists to ensure dankness.

Once a submission is accepted, a [Pepe Cheques](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Cheques) will be required to be burnt to have the art entered into the [Notable Pepes](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) directory.

There is an initial supply of 2,000 Pepe Cheques that is distributed as follows.

**Pepe Cheques can be acquired in 3 ways:**

1. Any artist will be able to claim a Pepe Check any time by buying and burning a [FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) card on Counterparty (by adding the ETH address in the transaction memo of a FAKEASF destruction). Since there were 1350 FAKEASF in circulation at the time of writing, 1350 of the 2000 Pepe Cheques were earmarked for this type of claim.
2. There was also an initial airdrop in two phases:
   1. The first was to artists who have submitted a Rare Pepe or Fake Rare. The airdrop was based on a snapshot of registered ETH addresses on **Friday, 17th February at 5PM EST**.
   2. After the Pepe Cheques for artists were allocated, the remaining ones were distributed randomly to Pepe Checks holders.
3. The final way to acquire a Pepe Cheques is to buy one on secondary market on Ethereum.

{% hint style="info" %}
Supply for most cards in series 2 will be in the range of 100-200, however we may loosen up our standards here to allow for some sub-100 issuance cards or very high issuance cards. Similarly, we may experiment with different pricing on cards with such supply.
