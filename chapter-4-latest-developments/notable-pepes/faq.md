# FAQ

{% hint style="warning" %}
These answers are meant to guide artists and collectors through the current evolution of Notable Pepes and their collecting process. Notable Pepes are an ever-evolving experiment and all answers in this FAQ are subject to change without prior notice.
{% endhint %}

### 1. How do I participate in a Notable Pepes Drops?

All [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holdings will act as an access pass for collectors, representing a raffle ticket for each mint's allowlist.

### 2. Where can I purchase Notable Pepes?

[https://opensea.io/collection/notablepepes](https://opensea.io/collection/notablepepes)

### 3. How are the allowlists created?

Allowlists are currently generated using https://www.apollo.xyz/&#x20;

For more information on how their on-chain provably fair raffles are conducted please visit https://docs.apollo.xyz/apollo-documentation/extensions/project/token-based-raffle/how-we-ensure-fairness

### 4. If I own multiple Notable Pepes can I win multiple allowlist spots?

You can win 1 allowlist spot for every [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) you hold. The more Notables you hold, the more likely it is for you to win more AL spots. It is also entirely possible you will win no spots at all.

### 5. When is the snapshot taken?

The snapshot will usually be taken within 24 hours of the drop. An exact time will not be announced to avoid anyone gaming the snapshot.

### 6. When will the allowlists be announced?

The various Phases of each drop will be announced as far in advance as possible, usually a few hours prior. The allowlists will be published for each card on its respective page within the [Notable Pepes collection on Pepe.wtf.](https://pepe.wtf/collection/Notable-Pepes)

{% hint style="success" %}
**Coming soon**: The [Pepe.wtf](../pepe.wtf.md) team is working on a dashboard where you can sign in with an ETH address and see any claims available for you and any drops you are able to mint without needing to search each AL individually.
{% endhint %}

### 7. What are my odds of being selected for allowlist?

Odds of getting at least 1 Phase1 AL spot for any given drop =&#x20;

**1 - \[ ((TNP - N)/TNP) ^ (S x AM)]**

_TNP = total # of Notable Pepes_&#x20;

_N = # of Notable Pepes you own_

_S = # of spots remaining after artist, treasury, and full set holders have been allocated_&#x20;

_AM = allocation multiplier_

### 8. What are the phases?

**Phase1** of each drop has 1.3x as many spots as there are available Notable Pepes in that drop.

For Series 2, 10% of the available supply from each drop is allocated to a second AL1 raffle for full set [Series 1](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holders. For example, on a 100 issuance card, 80 supply is available via the drop, which means 8 AL1 spots get raffled amongst the 25-30 full set holders.

If the drop does not sellout during Phase1, **Phase2** will be activated roughly 20 min after Phase1 closes, and has 4x as many spots as there were Notable Pepes initially available.

### 9. Is it advantageous to split up my Pepe Checks into multiple wallets?

There is no higher probability of being selected for allowlist spots by splitting up your Pepe Checks.

### 10. If my address is selected for Phase1 can I be in Phase2?

No. If an address has been selected in Phase1 it currently cannot be selected again in Phase2.

### 11. Why are drops over-allocated?

Phase1 is generally over-allocated 1.3x and Phase2 is over-allocated 4x. This is to ensure all Notable Pepes find a home. As your odds are 3â…“ x higher receiving claims in Phase2, there is a cap placed on Phase2 winners based on 30% of the max claim in Phase1.

I.e. If the most claims any wallet received in Phase1 was 10, the cap would be placed at 3 max per wallet in Phase2.&#x20;

### 12. How many drops are there?

There are usually 5 drops every Sunday.

### 13. How many cards are there in each series?

There are 50 cards in each series.

### 14. How much does each card cost?

The current price for each card is 0.069 ETH (we may experiment with different pricing on cards with very high supply/issuance).

### 15. Is there an advantage to holding cards?

All [Notable Pepe](https://pepe.wtf/collection/notable-pepes) holdings will act as an access pass for collectors, representing a raffle ticket for each mint's allowlist. There will also be regular [Notable Claims](https://notableclaims.pepe.wtf/) available to hodlers.

### 16. Will Pepe Checks be burned?

The only current burn mechanism is 100,000 Pepe Checks for 1 Tungsten Cube.

### 17. What are Pepe Cheques?

[Pepe Cheques](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Cheques) is the card required for an artist to burn once their card has been accepted into the registry. The card will act as an access pass for creators to submitting art, which they can do via the [submission portal](https://pepe.wtf/submission) on [pepe.wtf](../pepe.wtf.md).

### 18. As an artist, when do I burn my Pepe Cheques?

Artists are only required to burn a Pepe Cheque after their artwork has been selected by the Notable Pepe Scientists into the directory.
