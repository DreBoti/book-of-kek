### 1. How do I participate in a Notable Pepes Drops?

You must currently hold at least 1 [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) for a chance to win an allowlist spot.

### 2. Where can I purchase Pepe Checks?

[https://opensea.io/collection/notablepepes](https://opensea.io/collection/notablepepes)

### 3. How are the allowlists created?

A snapshot of all Pepe Checks holders is usually taken within 24 hours of the drop. A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is then used to select individual Pepe Checks for 2 phases of allowlist spots. The total amount of Checks selected for a given wallet are binned together to finalize the number of claims an individual wallet has.

### 4. If I own multiple Pepe Checks can I win multiple allowlist spots?

You can win 1 allowlist spot for every [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) you hold. The more checks you hold, the more likely it is for you to win more AL spots. It is also entirely possible you will win no spots at all.

### 5. When is the snapshot taken?

The snapshot will usually be taken within 24 hours of the drop. An exact time will not be announced to avoid anyone gaming the snapshot.

### 6. When will the allowlists be announced?

The various Phases of each drop will be announced as far in advance as possible, usually a few hours prior. The allowlists will be published for each card on its respective page within the [Notable Pepes collection on Pepe.wtf.](https://pepe.wtf/collection/Notable-Pepes)

### 7. What are my odds of being selected for allowlist?

Odds of getting at least 1 Phase1 AL spot for any given week:

**1 - \[ ((237,869 - N)/237,869) ^ (S x 1.5)]**

N = # of Pepe Checks you own

S = # of spots available across all drops. For a drop of 250, S = 200

### 8. What are the phases?

**Phase1** of each drop has 1.5x as many spots as there are available Notable Pepes in that drop. If the drop does not sellout during Phase1, **Phase2** will be activated roughly 20 min after Phase1 closes, and has 5x as many spots as there were Notable Pepes initially available.

### 9. Is it advantageous to split up my Pepe Checks into multiple wallets?

There is no higher probability of being selected for allowlist spots by splitting up your Pepe Checks.

### 10. If my address is selected for Phase1 can I be in Phase2?

No. If an address has been selected in Phase1 it currently cannot be selected again in Phase2.

### 11. Why are drops over-allocated?

Phase1 is generally over-allocated 1.5x and Phase2 is over-allocated 5x. This is to ensure all Notable Pepes find a home. As your odds are 3â…“ x higher receiving claims in Phase2, there is a cap placed on Phase2 winners based on 30% of the max claim in Phase1.

I.e. If the most claims any wallet received in Phase1 was 10, the cap would be placed at 3 max per wallet in Phase2.&#x20;

### 12. How many drops are there?

There are usually 5 drops every Sunday.

### 13. How many cards are there in each series?

There are 50 cards in each series.

### 14. How much does each card cost?

The current price for each card is 0.069 ETH.

### 15. Is there an advantage to holding cards?

There might be rewards and other mechanics given to card holders moving forward.

### 16. Will Pepe Checks be burned?

The only current burn mechanism is 100,000 Pepe Checks for 1 Tungsten Cube.

### 17. What are Pepe Cheques?

[Pepe Cheques](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Cheques) is the card required for an artist to burn once their card has been accepted into the registry.

### 18. As an artist, when do I burn my Pepe Cheques?

Artists are only required to burn a Pepe Cheque after their artwork has been selected by the Notable Pepe Scientists into the directory.
