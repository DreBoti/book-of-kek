### 1. How do I participate in a Notable Pepes Drop?

You must hold at least 1 [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) for a chance to win an allowlist spot.

### 2. Where can I purchase Pepe Checks?

All cards in the Notable Pepes collection are available on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/notablepepes).

### 3. How are the allowlists created?

Allowlists are created by randomly drawing [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) holders from a snapshot taken close to the drop.

### 4. Can I win multiple allowlist spots?

You can win 1 allowlist spot for every [Pepe Checks](https://pepe.wtf/asset/Pepe-Checks) you hold, for every single drop. The more checks you hold, the more likely it is for you to win more AL spots. It is also entirely possible you will win no spots at all.

### 5. When is the snapshot taken?

The snapshot will be taken usually within 24 hours of the drop. An exact time will not be announced to avoid gaming the snapshot.

### 6. When will the allowlists be announced?

The various Phases of each drop will be announced as far in advance as possible, usually a few hours prior.

### 7. What are my odds of being selected for allowlist?

Your odds of being chosen for an allowlist = (# of checks you hold / 237,869) x # of allowlist spots

### 8. What are the phases?

**Phase1** of each drop has 1.5x spots as there are Notable Pepes available.

**Phase2**, which will happen roughly 20 min after Phase1 closes, provided there are any Notable Pepes left, has 5x as many spots as there were Notable Pepes available.

### 9. If I am selected for Phase1 can I be in Phase2?

No. If you are selected in Phase 1 you cannot be in Phase2.&#x20;

### 10. Why are drops over-allocated?

Phase1 is generally over-allocated 1.5x and Phase2 is over-allocated 5x. This is to ensure all Notable Pepes find a home. As your odds are 3â…“ x higher receiving claims in Phase2, there is a 30% cap based on the max claims of any wallet in Phase1, placed on Phase2 winners.&#x20;

I.e. If the most claims any wallet received in Phase1 was 10, the cap would be placed at 3 max per wallet in Phase2.&#x20;

### 11. How many drops are there?

There are usually 5 drops every Sunday.

### 12. Will Pepe Checks be burned?

The only current burn mechanism is 100,000 checks for 1 Tungsten Cube.

### 13. What are Pepe Cheques?

Pepe Cheques are the card required for an artist to burn once their card has been accepted into the registry.

### 14. As an artist, when do I burn my Pepe Cheques?

Artists are only required to burn a Pepe Cheque after their artwork has been selected by the Notable Pepe Scientists into the directory.
