During the [Bitcoin Miami Conference](https://b.tc/conference/), [The Chambers Project](https://thechambersproject.com/) along side [Scarce.city](https://scarce.city/) hosted the ["Frogs over Fiat" event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/frogs-over-fiat-tickets-308377715047). The event lasted 6-9th of April.

While there, attendees were able to enjoy free beverage, the closing hours of Scarce.city's Fake Rare auction (more on that below) and a Rare & Fake Rare gallery.

Many iconic creations were featured, including the likes of [Pepenardo](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Pepenardo), [Rare Scrilla](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Rare-Scrilla), CES, MEAR, [Indelible](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Indelible), [Zetra](https://pepe.wtf/artists/ZETRA), [RYR](https://pepe.wtf/artists/RYR), [Kane Mayfield](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Kane-Mayfield), Sketch, [Mr Hansel](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mr-Hansel), [Easy B](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Easy-B), [Optimist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Optimist), [Viva La Vandal](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Viva-La-Vandal), Itchy Larry as well as the entire Fake Rare Directory.

As the Scarce.city Pepe tradition dictates, an auction was held on their native marketplace.
