**Series 6, Card 16** - [DAPPERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DAPPERPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1M4JpknVSo4RGghewZ9jgcvMYHRLVMGGCU). They created a total of 6 cards for the Rare Pepe series including [PEPETRADER](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETRADER) and [PEPESSANGE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPESSANGE).  &#x20;

The man on the card is American film actor, [Clark Gable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark\_Gable) on the set of the 1936 film "[Wife vs. Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife\_vs.\_Secretary)". It appears Mr. Gable is doing some leisure reading between takes, or reading his script while enjoying a cold beverage.&#x20;
