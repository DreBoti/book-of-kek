![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S03 C04 - BOMINABLPEPE card and source.jpg>)

BOMINABLPEPE was created by an unknown artist who also created the cards EYEOFTHEPEPE and TSUPEPE. The source image as created by the artist [Bobby Chiu](https://www.imaginismstudios.com/bobby-chiu) of [Imaginism Studios](https://www.imaginismstudios.com/). The image is untitled, and I'm not sure how the Rare Pepe artist came across it because as far as I can tell, it was not published anywhere except for the above linked bio page. Bobby one of three character designers credited for Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. &#x20;
