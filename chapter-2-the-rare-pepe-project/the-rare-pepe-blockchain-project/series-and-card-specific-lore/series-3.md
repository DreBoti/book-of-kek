The source image as created by the artist [Bobby Chiu](https://www.imaginismstudios.com/bobby-chiu) of [Imaginism Studios](https://www.imaginismstudios.com/).

Bobby is one of three character designers credited for Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. &#x20;

**Series 3, Card 46** - [RPEPEARMANDO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RPEPEARMANDO) was created by artist [Yoni Terenzi](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Yoni-Terenzi), an Italian living in London. Although this card comes first in the series, it was minted one day after RAREPEPESS, making it the second sports NFT ever made. The image used for the card was a photograph of Argentine professional football player and manager [Diego Maradona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego\_Maradona) taken on June 2, 1986 by [David Cannon](http://davidcannonphotography.co.uk/) during the [World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA\_World\_Cup) match against South Korea in Mexico City.

Series 3, Card 47 - [RAREPEPESS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPESS) was created by artist [Yoni Terenzi](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Yoni-Terenzi), an Italian living in London. This asset was minted by Yoni on October 7th, 2016 and is almost certainly the first sports NFT ever made. The image used for the card was a photograph of American professional basketball player [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael\_Jordan) which was taken by [George Kalinsky](https://nypost.com/2021/09/07/msg-photographer-shares-stories-behind-michael-jordan-snaps/). This image is iconic because it was Jordan's first all-star appearance and it was the debut of his signature shoe - the [Air Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air\_Jordan). The moment was captured during the [slam dunk contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam\_Dunk\_Contest) in Indianapolis, Indiana in February 1985.&#x20;
