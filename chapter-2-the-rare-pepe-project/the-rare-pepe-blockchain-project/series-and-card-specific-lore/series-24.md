**Series 24, Card 41** - [PEPEWYATT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEWYATT) was created by the artist known as [Easy B](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Easy-B). He has a whopping 39 cards in the Rare Pepe project covering a broad range of topics from wrestlers to movie stars to comic books.&#x20;

The card is the artist's rendition of a [2020 Tee Shirt advertisement](https://twitter.com/WWEShop/status/1271102769756344322?s=20\&t=Xt6mmcf-CPH6gcBePYpFNQ) that appeared on Twitter. The man pictured is [Bray Wyatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray\_Wyatt), an American pro wrestler that is better known as The Fiend. Wyatt's catchphrase was "Follow the Buzzards," which was changed to "Follow the Blockchain" by Easy B. for his card.&#x20;

**Series 24, Card 48** - [PEPEPOLLOCK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPOLLOCK) was created by the French artist [Zed Erwan](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Zed-Erwan). This is one of 12 of his Rare Pepe cards. 9 of them were done by hand. The three that were created on the computer are [GOTHICPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOTHICPEPE), [PEPEKIM](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEKIM) and [PEPEPARIETAL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARIETAL). Zed's image is not really a parody of a particular Pollock piece, but more an homage to the style. The image pictured above is a section of Pollock's "Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist)." I was speaking with Zed on Twitter in September of 2022 (me in English, him in French) and he shared with me a photo of the actual paintbrush he used to create PEPEPOLLOCK.
