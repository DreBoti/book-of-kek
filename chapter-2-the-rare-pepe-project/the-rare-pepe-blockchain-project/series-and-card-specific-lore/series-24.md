**Series 24, Card 48** - [PEPEPOLLOCK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPOLLOCK) was created by the French artist [Zed Erwan](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Zed-Erwan). This is one of 12 of his Rare Pepe cards. 9 of them were done by hand. The three that were created on the computer are [GOTHICPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOTHICPEPE), [PEPEKIM](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEKIM) and [PEPEPARIETAL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARIETAL). Zed's image is not really a parody of a particular Pollock piece, but more an homage to the style. The image pictured above is a section of Pollock's "Number 1, 1950 (Lavender Mist)." I was speaking with Zed on Twitter in September of 2022 (me in English, him in French) and he shared with me a photo of the actual paintbrush he used to create PEPEPOLLOCK.
