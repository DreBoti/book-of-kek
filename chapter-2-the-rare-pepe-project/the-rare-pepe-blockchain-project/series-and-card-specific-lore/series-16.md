**Series 16, Card 17** - [PEPEAXEGANG](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEAXEGANG) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1HG3SoUvnpp9jkNunYqbzfYRYBMqXfQD3t). They only created two cards for the Rare Pepe project, the other one being [LIZZZFACEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LIZZFACEPEPE).&#x20;

Based on the axe logo at the top of this otherwise hand-drawn card my best guess is that the artist was making reference to the Chinese [gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Axe\_Gang) founded in 1921 of the same name that was popularized by the 2004 action-comedy film [_**Kung Fu Hustle**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung\_Fu\_Hustle).&#x20;
