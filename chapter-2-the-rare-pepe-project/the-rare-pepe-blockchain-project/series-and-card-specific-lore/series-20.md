**Series 20, Card 29** - [XONOTICPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/XONOTICPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/17PJddeDBSyKDCcJK9BnneLvZnbtBx5GC6). This was the only card created and submitted to the Rare Pepe project by the artist.&#x20;

The image on the card is a parody of the logo for the free and open-source first-person shooter video game [Xonotic](https://xonotic.org/). [The game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xonotic) was developed as a fork of the game Nexuiz in 2011.&#x20;

**Series 20, Card 41** - [STACYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/STACYPEPE) was created by [Oliver Morris](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oliver-Morris) who was only 14 at the time. Oliver created a total of three cards for the Rare Pepe project with the other two being [SECURITYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SECURITYPEPE) and [PEPETHEFROG](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETHEFROG).&#x20;

The card image is a parody of an image Morris found of Stacy Herbert, co-host of the television show [_The Keiser Report_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiser\_Report) where she was dressed as the [Tin Woodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin\_Woodman) from the book and film [_The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wonderful\_Wizard\_of\_Oz) for Halloween. He replaced the Silver element symbol (Ag) sign on her chest (did she not know that it should have been Sn for Tin?) for a PEPECASH Card and added a stock chart in the background which is representative of the show.&#x20;
