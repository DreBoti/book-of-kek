**Series 7 Card 23 -** [**COMEDYPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/COMEDYPEPE) is another amazing card by the artist [DAVINCI9](https://twitter.com/DavinciNine). In it, he transformed the English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer [Charlie Chaplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie\_Chaplin) into a green Pepe.  The image is of Chaplin as his most famous character - [The Tramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Tramp).&#x20;
