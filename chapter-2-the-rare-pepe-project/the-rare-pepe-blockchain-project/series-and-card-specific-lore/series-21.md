**Series 21, Card 41** - [MUNETOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MUNETOPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1HxpuXAdaWbGr81bRXE5GKKw3aPZxoxzBg). MUNETOPEPE is their only contribution to the Rare Pepe series. The card references [Tonomi Palisade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonomi\_Palisade) which is a Japanese castle located in the town of Kanegasaki. The illustration depicts [The Anecdote of the Brothers Sadato and Muneto](https://www.fukushima-museum.jp/abe-no-sadato-muneto/) which was painted by Konobu Kano in the early 1700's.  [ABE no Muneto](https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/ABE%20no%20Muneto.html) was a Japanese military commander in the mid Heian period. I am unclear how the sour plum blossom relates to either the town or the person on the card.&#x20;
