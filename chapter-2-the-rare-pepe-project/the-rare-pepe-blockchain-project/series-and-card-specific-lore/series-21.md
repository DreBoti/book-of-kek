**Series 21, Card 26** - [DUMMIES](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DUMMIES) was created by the artist known as [Finest Rares](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Finest-Rares). He created a total of 18 cards for the Rare Pepe series including the two card "Baby Series" ([TUBBIES](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TUBBIES) and [PEPEPAMPERS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPAMPERS)).&#x20;

This card is a parody of the [For Dummies series of books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For\_Dummies). The first book in the series was DOS For Dummies which was published in late 1991.&#x20;

## Series 21, Card 30 - TADPOLEPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S21 C30 - TADPOLEPEPE.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 21, Card 30** - [TADPOLEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TADPOLEPEPE) was created by a Japanese artist known as [Mekabu](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mekabu). This card was inspired by a clay tadpole that was sculpted by the artist. As he said, "TADPOLEPEPE does not grow into a frog. It grows from a flat surface into a sculpture." Below is a photo of the clay tadpole given to me by Mekabu.

You'll notice at the bottom right of the card the word "memeclip" which is the name of the art group Mekabu and his wife attended. It means "to clip out the creativity of us (me and me) and keep it in the piece."

## Series 21, Card 41 - MUNETOPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S21 C41 - MUNETOPEPE source and card.jpg>)

**Series 21, Card 41** - [MUNETOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MUNETOPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1HxpuXAdaWbGr81bRXE5GKKw3aPZxoxzBg). MUNETOPEPE is their only contribution to the Rare Pepe series. The card references [Tonomi Palisade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonomi\_Palisade) which is a Japanese castle located in the town of Kanegasaki. The illustration depicts [The Anecdote of the Brothers Sadato and Muneto](https://www.fukushima-museum.jp/abe-no-sadato-muneto/) which was painted by Konobu Kano in the early 1700's.  [ABE no Muneto](https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/ABE%20no%20Muneto.html) was a Japanese military commander in the mid Heian period. I am unclear how the sour plum blossom relates to either the town or the person on the card.&#x20;
