**Series 27, Card 26** - [PEPELCHTNSTN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPELCHTNSTN) was created by the French artist Zed [Erwan](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Zed-Erwan). This card is a parody of [Roy Lichtenstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy\_Lichtenstein) ["Oh, Jeff...I Love You, Too...But..."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh,\_Jeff...I\_Love\_You,\_Too...But...) which was created in 1964 and is one of the artists' most famous [Pop art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop\_art) pieces. Below is a sketch Erwan shared with me on Twitter which was then colored digitally.&#x20;
