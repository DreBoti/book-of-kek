**Series 26, Card 25** - [TETSUWANPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TETSUWANPEPE) was created by the artist known as [Easy B](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Easy-B). Mr. B created a whopping 39 cards for the Rare Pepe project! TETSUWANPEPE is the artists rendition of the Japanese Manga character [Astro Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro\_Boy). Also known as Mighty Atom, the android young boy with human emotions was created by [Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu\_Tezuka) and was published by [Kobunsha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobunsha) from 1952 to 1968. In a [recent interview](https://youtu.be/SEL23QKS\_SQ) with Zero G, Easy B displayed his first attempt at his TETSUWANPEPE card (pictured below) which was rejected by the Rare Pepe Scientists with the comment, "needs more original content."&#x20;
