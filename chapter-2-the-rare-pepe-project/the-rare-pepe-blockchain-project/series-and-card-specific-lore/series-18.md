**Series 18, Card 4** - [LUPEPEN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LUPEPEN) was created by the artist [Luca](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Luca) ([@Rare\_Luca](https://twitter.com/Rare\_Luca) on Twitter). Luca created 18 cards for the Rare Pepe series including the popular [PEPEBASQUIAT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBASQUIAT), the tranquil [KOIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KOIPEPE), [PEPECLUB](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECLUB), and [PEPEFICTION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPFICTION).&#x20;

The images were taken from the Japanese animated made-for-TV film [Lupin III (Part 4)](https://theartarchivee.com/2018/07/28/retro-retrospective-lupin-iii-part-4/). These films, staring the [Manga character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin\_the\_Third) of the same name aired yearly between 1989 and 2013. The sign at the bottom left appears to be taken from the [2014 Mt. Gox protestors](https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5425220/protest-at-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-in-tokyo).
