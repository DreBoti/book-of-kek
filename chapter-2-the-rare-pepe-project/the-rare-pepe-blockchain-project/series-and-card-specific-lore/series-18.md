The images were taken from the Japanese animated made-for-TV film [Lupin III (Part 4)](https://theartarchivee.com/2018/07/28/retro-retrospective-lupin-iii-part-4/). These films, staring the [Manga character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin\_the\_Third) of the same name aired yearly between 1989 and 2013. The sign at the bottom left appears to be taken from the [2014 Mt. Gox protestors](https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5425220/protest-at-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-in-tokyo).

**Series 18, Card 10** - [PEPEKYRIE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEKYRIE) was created by [Ariya Minase](https://twitter.com/aria\_minase). She created a total of four cards for the Rare Pepe series including the Pok√©mon parody [BULBAPEPECRD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BULBAPEPECRD). The card is an adaptation of the 1989 Japanese arcade game [Valkyrie no Densetsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie\_no\_Densetsu). The game describes Valkyrie's companion Kurino Xandra as "lizard-like" but we all know it's really a frog . &#x20;

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S18 C18 - PEPEBEARD card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 18, Card 18** - [PEPEBEARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBEARD) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1Gpe8KHgZpgzpVLwri1UnU99wwCUWmm3cs). They created a total of nine Rare Pepe cards for the series including [BATBUTBOO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BATBUTBOO) which is a very funny story behind it which can be found in the [Series 12 section](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-12).  \
\
PEPEBEARD is a parody of the purported [flag of Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag\_of\_Blackbeard) which was attributed to Edward Teach (or Thatch), who was better known as [Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard) the Pirate. As you can see from the image above, the original flag did not contain the severed head of [Wojak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojak) (or anyone else for that matter).&#x20;
