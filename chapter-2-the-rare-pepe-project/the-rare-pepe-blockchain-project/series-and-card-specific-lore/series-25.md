**Series 25, Card 9** - [TOBIASPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TOBIASPEPE) was created by the artist [OE](https://pepe.wtf/artists/OE). It is an homage to the character [Tobias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Arrested\_Development\_characters#Tobias\_F%C3%BCnke) from the American television sitcom [Arrested Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested\_Development). Tobias was played by the stand-up comedian [David Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Cross). The original image was taken from Episode 7 of Season 1 entitled ["In God We Trust"](https://arresteddevelopment.fandom.com/wiki/In\_God\_We\_Trust).  OE shared some early drafts of this iconic card in the Telegram recently stating, "It went through a couple iterations before reaching its final dankness."

Yamaguchi stabbed Asanuma with a wakizashi short sword during a live televised election debate in Tokyo. Yamaguchi was only 17 at the time.
