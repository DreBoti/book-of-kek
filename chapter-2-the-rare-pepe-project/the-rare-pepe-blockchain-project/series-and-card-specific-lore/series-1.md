## Series 1, Card 1 - RAREPEPE

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/RAREPEPE.png)

**Series 1, Card 1 -** [**RAREPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) is the card that started it all. The anonymous artist that goes only by "Mike" posted a link to this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016 with little explanation. He was also the first and only "Rare Pepe Scientist" for cards 1 - 1,000. The image is a parody of Dorian Nakamoto who was falsely identified as the real Satoshi Nakamoto in a high-profile article in the US magazine "Newsweek" on March 6, 2014. You can read more about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto)

## Series 1, Card 25 - PEPEVIAGRA

![Original Image: Rokurokubi (long-necked monster) disguise](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C25 - PEPEVIAGRA card and origcopy.jpg>)

In the mid-1840s, ukiyo-e master [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa\_Kuniyoshi) (1797-1861) created a number of woodblock prints showing legendary [tanuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki) (raccoon dogs) using their humorously large scrota in creative ways. You can view them [here](http://pinktentacle.com/2009/06/all-purpose-tanuki-testicles-prints-by-kuniyoshi/). In 2016 an unknown artist took it upon himself to update Kuniyoshi's image by turning the Rokurokubi into a Pepe and the wielder of the monster a Wojak.&#x20;
