## Series 1, Card 1 - RAREPEPE

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/RAREPEPE.png)

**Series 1, Card 1 -** [**RAREPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) is the card that started it all. The anonymous artist that goes only by "Mike" posted a link to this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016 with little explanation. He was also the first and only "Rare Pepe Scientist" for cards 1 - 1,000. The image is a parody of Dorian Nakamoto who was falsely identified as the real Satoshi Nakamoto in a high-profile article in the US magazine "Newsweek" on March 6, 2014. You can read more about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto)

## Series 1, Card 2 - GOXPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C02 - GOXPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 2 -** [**GOXPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOXPEPE) was created by "Mike" the same person who started the whole Rare Pepe project when he released the above RAREPEPE card. He also created [SHITCOINCARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SHITCOINCARD), [TRUMPRARE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TRUMPRARE), [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH), and [UFOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UFOPEPE). Mike was also the first Rare Pepe Scientist. He took on the responsibility of examining each card submission and approving the very best for inclusion in the Rare Pepe Directory. The person pictured on the card is [Mark Karpelès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Karpel%C3%A8s) who was the former CEO of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. GOX. Karpelès was [arrested](https://www.ndtv.com/business/former-ceo-of-collapsed-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-arrested-in-japan-report-1202733) in Japan in 2015 for allegations of fraud that led to the collapes of Mt. Gox.

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C04 - PEPENATION card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 4** - [**PEPENATION**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION) was created by [Theo Goodman](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Theo-Goodman). You can read more about Theo in the GURUPEPE write-up below. Pictured in the card is [Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/susanne-tarkowski-tempelhof) of the project BitNation. The firm partnered with Spacechain in 2015 to create a peer-to-peer research service to study the cosmos. [Here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitnation-spacechain-the-mission-to-decentralize-space-exploration) is an interview with Susanne that discusses the project in detail.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 10 - STILLPEPE

![Screen Capture from the "Still D.R.E." Music Video](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C10 - STILLPEPE card and source.jpg>)

[STILLPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/STILLPEPE) was created by [Joe Looney](https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf). Not only did Joe create 13 amazing Rare Pepe cards including [PEPEPARTY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARTY), [IMWITHPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/IMWITHPEPE), [PEPEGOTCHI](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEGOTCHI), and [BADHAIRDAY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BADHAIRDAY) he wrote the Rarepepe wallet software purely to benefit fans of Rare Pepe's. [Here](https://medium.com/@rareartlabs/rareaf-talks-joe-looney-rare-pepe-wallet-db309924c72b) is a Medium article where Joe was interviewed by R.A.R.E Art Labs about the RPW.

The STILLPEPE card displays "Pepefied" versions of American Rappers [Snoop Dogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop\_Dogg) and [Dr. Dre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr.\_Dre). A link to the video on YouTube is below.

## Series 1, Card 7 - PEPEPARTY

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C07 - PEPEPARTY card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 7 -** [PEPEPARTY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARTY) was another masterpiece created by Joe Looney (see [STILLPEPE](series-1.md#series-1-card-10-stillpepe) for further information about Joe). The card depicts three Counterparty developers who I believe are [Matt Elias](https://counterparty.io/team/matt-elias/) (Top Left) [Matt Young ](https://counterparty.io/team/matt-young/)(Top Right), and [Adam Krellenstein](https://counterparty.io/team/adam-krellenstein/) (Bottom). Bitcoin maximalists get angry at Counterparty users for trading Rare Pepes and other assets on "their" blockchain. Thus Joe's tongue-in-cheek "Spamming the block chain since January 2014" comment. In reality, they should be thanking Counterparty users. They gave Bitcoin an actual use case back in 2014-2016 and still do to this day.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 14 - GURUPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C14 - GURUPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 14 -** [**GURUPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GURUPEPE) was created by artist, auctioneer extraordinaire, and all around good guy [Theo Goodman](https://twitter.com/theog\_\_). He also created the Series 1 cards [PEPENATION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION), [KEISERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KEISERPEPE), [HYIPPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HYIPPEPE), and [PONZIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PONZIPEPE) along with several other great cards such as [EGGPLANTPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/EGGPLANTPEPE) and [GROYPERMONKY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GROYPERMONKY).

The man pictured on the card is Vinay Gupta, Co-Founder of Ethereum. As Theo put it, "he calls himself a GURU. He says a lot of random shit that "sounds smart" and sometimes has some good moments but also some like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d0pbn/how\_do\_you\_feel\_about\_vinay\_gupta\_saying\_that\_all/). It's funny, he kind of just went out of the spotlight, after making mega-millions during the first bull run of ETH. He was a major part of the founding of ETH, but many people from this wave have no idea who he is. Sure, a big guy that has trouble walking, saying that he is going to break peoples bones because they are white and buddist, is a great style. WATCH OUT he comes from a linage of warriors! The main issue is I've never seen him laugh at himself once."

[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulsingireddy/2017/10/18/vinay-gupta-on-why-ethereum-is-the-future/?sh=3e809c6856f2) is a lengthy article about him from Forbes. While researching the card, I asked the question "who is displayed in GURUPEPE?" to Theo, when Rare Pepe OG [Shawn Leary](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Shawn-Leary) jumped in with the answer. When I agreed with him, he followed up with one of the greatest one liners in Rare Pepe History: "I know I'm right. I'm a retired Rare Pepe Scientist." I should have known better than to question [Shawn](https://twitter.com/shawnleary)!&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 22 - DAOPEPEHACK

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C22 - DAOPEPEHACK card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 22 -** [DAOPEPEHACK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DAOPEPEHACK) was created by [Héctor Cárdenas](https://twitter.com/hcarpach). He also created [HARDPEPEFORK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HARDPEPEFORK), [PEPEMINING](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEMINING), and [RARECHAVEZ](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RARECHAVEZ). The person depicted in the card is [Stephan Tual](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/stephan-tual), the CCO of the Ethereum Foundation at the time of the first major hack on any blockchain entitled the [DAO Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_DAO\_\(organization\)) which ultimately split the Ethereum community into two camps - those that believed the blockchain should be rolled back to the pre-hack state and those that did not. This resulted in the formation of ETC or Ethereum Classic. [Here](https://medium.com/decentralize-today/q-a-stephan-tual-former-cco-of-ethereum-and-founder-of-slock-it-the-dao-cf934fe28a4c) is an interview with Stephan that was done on Medium by Ameer Rosic.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 24 - PEPEONECOIN

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C24 - PEPEONECOIN card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 24 -** [PEPEONECOIN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEONECOIN) was created by [DanDarkPill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill). Dan created 7 series 1 cards, the 6 card "Putin Set" and 7 card "Rare Pepe History of Art Series Set" along with several other very memorable cards in the set before deleting his Twitter profile and disappearing from the public eye.&#x20;

The person depicted in the card is [Ruji Ignatova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruja\_Ignatova) the founder of the OnceCoin Ponzi scheme. She was recently added to the [FBI's top 10 most wanted list](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/ruja-ignatova/@@download.pdf). Once known as the "cryptoqueen" Ignatova has been missing since 2017. She is wanted for defrauding victims out of more than 4 billion dollars. [Here](https://briefly.co.za/105908-ruja-ignatova-where-founder-ponzi-scheme-onecoin.html) is some further reading about Ignatova.

## Series 1, Card 25 - PEPEVIAGRA

![Original Image: Rokurokubi (long-necked monster) disguise](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C25 - PEPEVIAGRA card and origcopy.jpg>)

**Series 1 Card 25 -** [**PEPEVIAGRA**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEVIAGRA) **** was created by [DanDarkPill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill). In the mid-1840s, ukiyo-e master [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa\_Kuniyoshi) (1797-1861) created a number of woodblock prints showing legendary [tanuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki) (raccoon dogs) using their humorously large scrota in creative ways. You can view them [here](http://pinktentacle.com/2009/06/all-purpose-tanuki-testicles-prints-by-kuniyoshi/). In 2016 Dan took it upon himself to update Kuniyoshi's image by turning the Rokurokubi into a Pepe and the wielder of the monster a Wojak.&#x20;
