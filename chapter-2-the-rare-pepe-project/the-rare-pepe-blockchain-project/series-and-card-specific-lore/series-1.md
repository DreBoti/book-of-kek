## Series 1, Card 1 - RAREPEPE

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/RAREPEPE.png)

**Series 1, Card 1 -** [**RAREPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) is the card that started it all. The anonymous artist that goes only by "Mike" posted a link to this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016 with little explanation. He was also the first and only "Rare Pepe Scientist" for cards 1 - 1,000. The image is a parody of Dorian Nakamoto who was falsely identified as the real Satoshi Nakamoto in a high-profile article in the US magazine "Newsweek" on March 6, 2014. You can read more about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto)

## Series 1, Card 2 - GOXPEPE

**Series 1, Card 2 -** [**GOXPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOXPEPE) was created by "Mike" the same person who started the whole Rare Pepe project when he released the above RAREPEPE card. He also created [SHITCOINCARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SHITCOINCARD), [TRUMPRARE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TRUMPRARE), [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH), and [UFOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UFOPEPE). Mike was also the first Rare Pepe Scientist. He took on the responsibility of examining each card submission and approving the very best for inclusion in the Rare Pepe Directory. The person pictured on the card is [Mark Karpelès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Karpel%C3%A8s) who was the former CEO of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. GOX. Karpelès was [arrested](https://www.ndtv.com/business/former-ceo-of-collapsed-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-arrested-in-japan-report-1202733) in Japan in 2015 for allegations of fraud that led to the collapes of Mt. Gox.

[Here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitnation-spacechain-the-mission-to-decentralize-space-exploration) is an interview with Susanne that discusses the project in detail.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 14 - GURUPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C14 - GURUPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 14 -** [**GURUPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GURUPEPE) was created by artist, auctioneer extraordinaire, and all around good guy [Theo Goodman](https://twitter.com/theog\_\_). He also created the Series 1 cards [PEPENATION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION), [KEISERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KEISERPEPE), [HYIPPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HYIPPEPE), and [PONZIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PONZIPEPE) along with several other great cards such as [EGGPLANTPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/EGGPLANTPEPE) and [GROYPERMONKY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GROYPERMONKY).

The man pictured on the card is Vinay Gupta, Co-Founder of Ethereum. As Theo put it, "he calls himself a GURU. He says a lot of random shit that "sounds smart" and sometimes has some good moments but also some like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d0pbn/how\_do\_you\_feel\_about\_vinay\_gupta\_saying\_that\_all/). Its funny, he kind of just went out of the spotlight, after making mega-millions during the first bull run of ETH. He was a major part of the founding of ETH, but many people from this wave have no idea who he is. Sure, a big guy that has trouble walking saying that he is going to break peoples bones because they are white and buddist, its a great style. WATCH OUT he comes from a linage of warriors! the main issue is I've never seen him laugh at himself once."

[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulsingireddy/2017/10/18/vinay-gupta-on-why-ethereum-is-the-future/?sh=3e809c6856f2) is a lengthy article about him from Forbes. While researching the card, I asked the question "who is displayed in GURUPEPE?" to Theo, when Rare Pepe OG [Shawn Leary](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Shawn-Leary) jumped in with the answer. When I agreed with him, he followed up with one of the greatest one liners in Rare Pepe History: "I know I'm right. I'm a retired rare pepe scientist." I should have known better than to question [Shawn](https://twitter.com/shawnleary)!&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 25 - PEPEVIAGRA

![Original Image: Rokurokubi (long-necked monster) disguise](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C25 - PEPEVIAGRA card and origcopy.jpg>)

**Series 1 Card 25 -** [**PEPEVIAGRA**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEVIAGRA). In the mid-1840s, ukiyo-e master [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa\_Kuniyoshi) (1797-1861) created a number of woodblock prints showing legendary [tanuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki) (raccoon dogs) using their humorously large scrota in creative ways. You can view them [here](http://pinktentacle.com/2009/06/all-purpose-tanuki-testicles-prints-by-kuniyoshi/). In 2016 an unknown artist took it upon himself to update Kuniyoshi's image by turning the Rokurokubi into a Pepe and the wielder of the monster a Wojak.&#x20;
