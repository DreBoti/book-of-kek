## Series 1, Card 1 - RAREPEPE

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/RAREPEPE.png)

**Series 1, Card 1 -** [**RAREPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) is the card that started it all. The anonymous artist that goes only by "Mike" posted a link to this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016 with little explanation. He was also the first and only "Rare Pepe Scientist" for cards 1 - 1,000. The image is a parody of Dorian Nakamoto who was falsely identified as the real Satoshi Nakamoto in a high-profile article in the US magazine "Newsweek" on March 6, 2014. You can read more about it here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto)

## Series 1, Card 2 - GOXPEPE

**Series 1, Card 2 -** [**GOXPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOXPEPE) is in reference to Mark Karpel√®s who was the former CEO of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. GOX. You can learn more about him here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Karpel%C3%A8s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Karpel%C3%A8s)

## Series 1, Card 14 - GURUPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C14 - GURUPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 14 -** [**GURUPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GURUPEPE) was created by artist, auctioneer extraordinaire, and all around good guy [Theo Goodman](https://twitter.com/theog\_\_). He also created the Series 1 cards [PEPENATION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION), [KEISERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KEISERPEPE), [HYIPPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HYIPPEPE), and [PONZIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PONZIPEPE) along with several other great cards such as [EGGPLANTPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/EGGPLANTPEPE) and [GROYPERMONKY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GROYPERMONKY).

When researching the card, I asked the question "who is displayed in GURUPEPE?" to Theo, when Rare Pepe OG [Shawn Leary](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Shawn-Leary) jumped in with the now infamous quote, "I know I'm right. I'm a retired rare pepe scientist." I should have known better than to question [Shawn](https://twitter.com/shawnleary)!&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 25 - PEPEVIAGRA

![Original Image: Rokurokubi (long-necked monster) disguise](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C25 - PEPEVIAGRA card and origcopy.jpg>)

**Series 1 Card 25 -** [**PEPEVIAGRA**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEVIAGRA). In the mid-1840s, ukiyo-e master [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa\_Kuniyoshi) (1797-1861) created a number of woodblock prints showing legendary [tanuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki) (raccoon dogs) using their humorously large scrota in creative ways. You can view them [here](http://pinktentacle.com/2009/06/all-purpose-tanuki-testicles-prints-by-kuniyoshi/). In 2016 an unknown artist took it upon himself to update Kuniyoshi's image by turning the Rokurokubi into a Pepe and the wielder of the monster a Wojak.&#x20;
