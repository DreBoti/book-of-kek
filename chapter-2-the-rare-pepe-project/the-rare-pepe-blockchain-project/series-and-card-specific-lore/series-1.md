## Series 1, Card 1 - RAREPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C01 - RAREPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 1 -** [**RAREPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPE) is the card that started it all. The anonymous artist that goes only by "Mike" posted a link to this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016 with little explanation. He was also the first and only "Rare Pepe Scientist" for cards 1 - 1,000. The image is a parody of Dorian Nakamoto who was falsely identified as the real Satoshi Nakamoto in a [high-profile article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi\_Nakamoto) in the US magazine "Newsweek" on March 6, 2014.

## Series 1, Card 2 - GOXPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C02 - GOXPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 2 -** [**GOXPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOXPEPE) was created by "Mike" the same person who started the whole Rare Pepe project when he released the above RAREPEPE card. He also created [SHITCOINCARD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SHITCOINCARD), [TRUMPRARE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TRUMPRARE), [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH), and [UFOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UFOPEPE). Mike was also the first Rare Pepe Scientist. He took on the responsibility of examining each card submission and approving the very best for inclusion in the Rare Pepe Directory. The person pictured on the card is [Mark Karpelès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Karpel%C3%A8s) who was the former CEO of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. GOX. Karpelès was [arrested](https://www.ndtv.com/business/former-ceo-of-collapsed-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-arrested-in-japan-report-1202733) in Japan in 2015 for allegations of fraud that led to the collapes of Mt. Gox.

## Series 1, Card 4 - PEPENATION

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C04 - PEPENATION card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 4** - [**PEPENATION**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION) was created by [Theo Goodman](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Theo-Goodman). You can read more about Theo in the GURUPEPE write-up below. Pictured in the card is [Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/susanne-tarkowski-tempelhof) of the project BitNation. The firm partnered with Spacechain in 2015 to create a peer-to-peer research service to study the cosmos. [Here](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitnation-spacechain-the-mission-to-decentralize-space-exploration) is an interview with Susanne that discusses the project in detail.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 7 - PEPEPARTY

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C07 - PEPEPARTY card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 7 -** [**PEPEPARTY**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARTY) **** was another masterpiece created by Joe Looney (see [STILLPEPE](series-1.md#series-1-card-10-stillpepe) for further information about Joe). The card depicts three Counterparty developers - [Evan Wagner](https://counterparty.io/team/evan-wagner/) (Top Left), [Robby Dermody](https://counterparty.io/team/robby-dermody/)[ ](https://counterparty.io/team/matt-young/)(Top Right), and [Adam Krellenstein](https://counterparty.io/team/adam-krellenstein/) (Bottom). Bitcoin maximalists get angry at Counterparty users for trading Rare Pepes and other assets on "their" blockchain. Thus Joe's tongue-in-cheek "Spamming the block chain since January 2014" comment. In reality, they should be thanking Counterparty users. They gave Bitcoin an actual use case back in 2014-2016 and still do to this day.&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 10 - STILLPEPE

![Screen Capture from the "Still D.R.E." Music Video](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C10 - STILLPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 10** - [**STILLPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/STILLPEPE) was created by [Joe Looney](https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf). Not only did Joe create 13 amazing Rare Pepe cards including [PEPEPARTY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEPARTY), [IMWITHPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/IMWITHPEPE), [PEPEGOTCHI](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEGOTCHI), and [BADHAIRDAY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BADHAIRDAY) he wrote the Rarepepe wallet software purely to benefit fans of Rare Pepe's. [Here](https://medium.com/@rareartlabs/rareaf-talks-joe-looney-rare-pepe-wallet-db309924c72b) is a Medium article where Joe was interviewed by R.A.R.E Art Labs about the RPW.

The STILLPEPE card displays "Pepefied" versions of American Rappers [Snoop Dogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop\_Dogg) and [Dr. Dre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr.\_Dre). A link to the video on YouTube is below.

## Series 1, Card 14 - GURUPEPE

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C14 - GURUPEPE card and source.jpg>)

**Series 1, Card 14 -** [**GURUPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GURUPEPE) was created by artist, auctioneer extraordinaire, and all around good guy [Theo Goodman](https://twitter.com/theog\_\_). He also created the Series 1 cards [PEPENATION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENATION), [KEISERPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/KEISERPEPE), [HYIPPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HYIPPEPE), and [PONZIPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PONZIPEPE) along with several other great cards such as [EGGPLANTPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/EGGPLANTPEPE) and [GROYPERMONKY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GROYPERMONKY).

The man pictured on the card is Vinay Gupta, Co-Founder of Ethereum. As Theo put it, "he calls himself a GURU. He says a lot of random shit that "sounds smart" and sometimes has some good moments but also some like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7d0pbn/how\_do\_you\_feel\_about\_vinay\_gupta\_saying\_that\_all/). It's funny, he kind of just went out of the spotlight, after making mega-millions during the first bull run of ETH. He was a major part of the founding of ETH, but many people from this wave have no idea who he is. Sure, a big guy that has trouble walking, saying that he is going to break peoples bones because they are white and buddist, is a great style. WATCH OUT he comes from a linage of warriors! The main issue is I've never seen him laugh at himself once."

[Here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rahulsingireddy/2017/10/18/vinay-gupta-on-why-ethereum-is-the-future/?sh=3e809c6856f2) is a lengthy article about him from Forbes. While researching the card, I asked the question "who is displayed in GURUPEPE?" to Theo, when Rare Pepe OG [Shawn Leary](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Shawn-Leary) jumped in with the answer. When I agreed with him, he followed up with one of the greatest one liners in Rare Pepe History: "I know I'm right. I'm a retired Rare Pepe Scientist." I should have known better than to question [Shawn](https://twitter.com/shawnleary)!&#x20;

## Series 1, Card 19 - LUCKYPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C19 - LUCKYPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 19** - [LUCKYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LUCKYPEPE) was created by the mysterious figure [DanDarkPill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill). He created a total of 26 cards for the Rare Pepe project.&#x20;

The subject of this card is the [maneki-neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneki-neko) or "beckoning cat," a common Japanese figurine which is believed to bring good luck to shop owners. The earliest records of _maneki-neko_ appear in the Bukō nenpyō's (a chronology of [Edo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo)) entry dated 1852. Because of its popularity in Chinese and Vietnamese communities (including [Chinatowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown) in the United States), the _maneki-neko_ is frequently mistaken for being Chinese in origin rather than Japanese, and is therefore sometimes referred to as a "Chinese lucky cat."

## Series 1, Card 20 - CHERPEPEFOIL



<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C20 - CHERPEPEFOIL card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 20** - [CHERPEPEFOIL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CHERPEPEFOIL) was created by the late great [John Villar](https://pepe.wtf/artists/John-Villar). He may hold the record for most Rare Pepe cards in the project at 80. John created 50 cards specifically for the game [Rare Pepe Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfPkrAo25DM\&ab\_channel=JohnVillar) which he was working on at the time of his passing and another 40 cards beyond that including what is probably the first interactive digital art token - [PEPEBALT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBALT).

This card is a pepefied image of the American singer, actress and television personality [Cher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher). The card quotes a lyric from her song [Believe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Believe\_\(Cher\_song\))

## Series 1, Card 21 - PEPEBROS

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C21 - PEPEBROS card and source (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 1, Card 21** - [PEPEBROS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBROS) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1698Gs1WEs8pyvLoyYZWVqhbBGE5uYCmSL). They only created two cards for the Rare Pepe project. The other one being [MAGICPEPEYE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MAGICPEPEYE).&#x20;

This card pays homage to the 1985 platform game developed by [Nintendo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo) for the [Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo\_Entertainment\_System) (NES) called [Super Mario Bros.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_Mario\_Bros.) It appears that the artist created his own scene from the game, or perhaps took a scene, increased the size until it was at a 1:1 pixel ratio and then added the sun with the face of a [Wojak](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak). &#x20;

## Series 1, Card 22 - DAOPEPEHACK

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C22 - DAOPEPEHACK card and source.jpg>)

The person depicted in the card is [Stephan Tual](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/stephan-tual), the CCO of the Ethereum Foundation at the time of the first major hack on any blockchain entitled the [DAO Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_DAO\_\(organization\)) which ultimately split the Ethereum community into two camps - those that believed the blockchain should be rolled back to the pre-hack state and those that did not. This resulted in the formation of ETC or Ethereum Classic. [Here](https://medium.com/decentralize-today/q-a-stephan-tual-former-cco-of-ethereum-and-founder-of-slock-it-the-dao-cf934fe28a4c) is an interview with Stephan that was done on Medium by Ameer Rosic.&#x20;

She was recently added to the [FBI's top 10 most wanted list](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/ruja-ignatova/@@download.pdf). Once known as the "cryptoqueen" Ignatova has been missing since 2017. She is wanted for defrauding victims out of more than 4 billion dollars. [Here](https://briefly.co.za/105908-ruja-ignatova-where-founder-ponzi-scheme-onecoin.html) is some further reading about Ignatova.

## Series 1, Card 25 - PEPEVIAGRA

![Original Image: Rokurokubi (long-necked monster) disguise](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S01 C25 - PEPEVIAGRA card and origcopy.jpg>)

**Series 1 Card 25 -** [**PEPEVIAGRA**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEVIAGRA) **** was created by [DanDarkPill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill). In the mid-1840s, ukiyo-e master [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa\_Kuniyoshi) (1797-1861) created a number of woodblock prints showing legendary [tanuki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki) (raccoon dogs) using their humorously large scrota in creative ways. You can view them [here](http://pinktentacle.com/2009/06/all-purpose-tanuki-testicles-prints-by-kuniyoshi/). In 2016 Dan took it upon himself to update Kuniyoshi's image by turning the Rokurokubi into a Pepe and the wielder of the monster a Wojak.&#x20;

He is credited with five cards in the Rare Pepe project, but Rob may be most known for a card that he collaborated on known as [LORDKEK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LORDKEK).&#x20;

For this card, Rob used an image from the international public art exhibit known as the [CowParade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CowParade). This exhibit has been featured in major world cities and allows local artists to decorate fiberglass sculptures of cows which are then placed in public places in the city. The original cow sculpture was created by the Swiss-born sculptor [Pascal Knapp](https://www.pascalknapp.com/). The cow pictured is known as Taxi Cow and was displayed in New York City. It was later offered for sale as a [figurine](https://www.ebay.com/itm/203051343052). You can find the image in [this article](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/cow-tunnels/) which looks at the history of cow tunnels in New York during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&#x20;

According to the user Trout on Telegram, the card was named after him and was created because he was a well known altcoin trader on Twitter back in the day. The symbols under the trout's fin represent some of the altcoin bags Trout was holding at the time. The term [shitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shitcoin.asp) refers to any altcoin created after Bitcoin that has little to no value or discernible purpose.
