<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S04 C04 - SALTYTADPEPE card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 4, Card 4** - [**SALTYTADPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SALTYTADPEPE) was created by  an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1K91tkFMHE8ZucozbBJGxHniCQfoCKRiKy). They created a total of 4 cards for the Rare Pepe series including [SADMILKPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SADMILKPEPE) and [BLOCKPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BLOCKPEPE).\
\
The background of the card is a section of the [color woodblock print](https://ukiyo-e.org/image/aic/99030\_512676) _"The Great Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjurokkei)"_ by the Japanese artist [Katsushika Hokusai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokusai) between 1830 and 1832.&#x20;

## Series 4, Card 13 - RPJAILEXIT

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S04 C13 - RPJAILEXIT card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 4, Card 13** - [RPJAILEXIT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RPJAILEXIT) was created by the artist [Yoni Terenzi](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Yoni-Terenzi), an Italian living in London. Yoni told me he made this card "dreaming to use it IRL to get out of troubles." He also made two of the earliest sports NFT's - [RPEPEARMANDO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RPEPEARMANDO) and [RAREPEPESS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RAREPEPESS). In total Yoni made 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project.

The card is a copy of one of the many "Chance" cards that are part of the board game [Monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly\_\(game\)). The original [Get Out of Jail Free ](https://monopoly.fandom.com/wiki/Get\_out\_of\_Jail\_Free\_\(card\))image has been used on everything from clothes to fine art. So it being part of the Rare Pepe project is no surprise. &#x20;

## Series 4, Card 14 - LEANPEPE

**Series 4, Card 15 -** [**UNLUCKYPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UNLUCKYPEPE) was created by the mysterious artist known only as "[Dan Dark Pill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill)" who has since removed his account from Twitter. Dan created some of the most valuable Rare Pepe cards in existence including two 1 of 1 cards - [ONLYONEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/ONLYONEPEPE) and [REDPUTINPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/REDPUTINPEPE). He also created a whole series of fine art parody pieces, the Putin Series, and the extremely rare 1 of 29 card [DARKPILLPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DARKPILLPEPE).&#x20;

The source image is a 10 year old meme known as "[Bad Luck Brian](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-luck-brian)" which has been used for years on redit for jokes relating to bad news.

**Series 4, Card 24** - [**PEPEDANCE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEDANCE) was created by the duo [Nicolas Sierro](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Nicolas-Sierro) ([@NicolasSierro](https://twitter.com/NicolasSierro) on Twitter) and Hilaire De Rien ([@HilaireDeRien](https://twitter.com/HilaireDeRien) on Twitter).

While the card states that it is a tribute to the American dancer, actor, and singer [Fred Astaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred\_Astaire), the image the artists chose to display on the card is [RanXerox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RanXerox) from the Italian science fiction graphic novel series of the same name.

## Series 4, Card 44 - RERERPERP

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S04 C44 - RERERPERP card and source.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 4, Card 44** - [RERERPERP](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RERERPERP) was created by the artist known as [Django Bits](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Django-Bits). He created a total of 13 cards for the Rare Pepe project including the extremely rare and valuable [PEPEALASSAD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEALASSAD).&#x20;

The image on the card is from a meme that started in 2012 known as [Ermahgerd](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ermahgerd). Django wrote the card as it is imagined the girl would talk. Part of the meme was that the captions were meant to sound like a speech impediment caused by the use of an orthodontic retainer. Many years later, it was revealed that the girl in the photo is a women named Maggie Goldenberger who is now a nurse in Arizona. You can read an interview about Maggie and the origins of the meme [here](https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/interviews/maggie-goldenberger-reflects-on-her-experience-becoming-the-ermahgerd-meme-and-why-she-ultimately-learned-to-love-it).&#x20;
