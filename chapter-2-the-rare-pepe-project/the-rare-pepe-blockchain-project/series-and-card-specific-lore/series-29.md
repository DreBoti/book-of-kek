She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni had this to say about this card, "I drew this because i wanted to draw a ninja. I used Chinese characters and other elements to give it a bit of a Japanese feel. The ninja hides in the moonlit night, blends in with the darkness, and stealthily assassinates his opponents. The owner of the card might get killed?"
