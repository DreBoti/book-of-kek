For the start of Series 23, MrHansel ([https://twitter.com/bettidlomas](https://twitter.com/bettidlomas)) created "GUYBRUSH THREEPEPE", a takeoff on the name of the lead character Guybrush Threepwood from the 1991 LucasArts Personal Computer game "[Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey\_Island\_2:\_LeChuck's\_Revenge)". I have no idea how someone could 1 - play or remember playing a 21 year old game that only sold 25,000 copies, 2 - grab a stock image of the character, 3 - overlay that onto a background that only appears once in the entire game, and 4 - decide that would make a great Pepe! They say there is a fine line between genius and madness and I would say MrHansel is 100% the former.  &#x20;
