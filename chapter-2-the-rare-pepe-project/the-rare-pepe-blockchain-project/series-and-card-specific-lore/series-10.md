**Series 10, Card 21** - [BRIGHTONPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BRIGHTONPEPE) was created by CounterParty Developer and Rare Pepe Scientist, [Shawn Leary](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Shawn-Leary). Shawn created a total of 15 cards for the Rare Pepe series including Series 1 greats such as [DANKPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DANKPEPE), [BUPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BUPEPE), and [TLCPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TLCPEPE). BRIGHTONPEPE is one of three cards that lampoon the controversial podcast [Bitcoin Uncensored](https://www.coindesk.com/people/bitcoin-uncensored/) and it's hosts - Junseth and Chris DeRose.&#x20;

[DeRose's](https://twitter.com/chrisderose\_?lang=en) Twitter handle was once @brighton36 which is where the card name comes from. DeRose was allegedly arrested for streaking at a waterpark which gave Shawn the idea for a [Wanted Poster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted\_poster).
