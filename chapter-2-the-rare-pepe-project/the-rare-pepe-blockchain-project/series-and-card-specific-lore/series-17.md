![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/S17 C15 - MEMESTEALER source and card.jpg>)

**Series 17, Card 15** - [MEMESTEALER ](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MEMESTEALER)was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/15qdhYM8WXZQUCPsR1oeoWkfCmBgeUZXht). The image on the card is taken from the cover of a 1990 board game expansion pack called [**Space Hulk: Genestealer Expansion.**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13393/space-hulk-genestealer-expansion) **** The board game [Space Hulk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space\_Hulk) was released in 1989 by the company [Games Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games\_Workshop). The card creator had a total of 8 cards accepted into the Rare Pepe project including what has to be one of the earliest known examples of a vIRL (virtual in real life) - [PEPETSHIRT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETSHIRT). In this case, purchasing the digital asset PEPETSHIRT entitled you to an actual tee shirt being sent to your home as well as a "receipt" in the form of another digital asset - [GOTPEPESHIRT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOTPEPESHIRT).&#x20;
