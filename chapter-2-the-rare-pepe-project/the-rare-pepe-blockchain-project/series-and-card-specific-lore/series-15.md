**Series 15, Card 41** - KOIPEPE was created by the artist known as [Luca](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Luca). He created a total of 19 cards for the Rare Pepe project. This is one of two cards with a Japanese influence. The other one being [UKIYOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UKIYOEPEPE).

The original image is from an antique scroll but I have been unable to determine the artist. So far the only place I've been able to locate it is on Pintrest boards, but they do not give any information.
