RUBBERPEPE was created by an unknown artist. The artist also created the cards THEANCAPEPE, STEALPEPE, PPKING, PREPEDATOR, and SCORPEPE. The card appears to be a hand drawn interpretation of the character Johnny played by [Chris Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris\_Cunningham) in the 2005 British experimental short film/music video which was written, directed, and produced by Cunningham as well. In the opening scene, an off screen voice can be heard saying, "do you want mama to come in?" Which causes Johnny to throw a fit for which he is then given a sedative to calm him down. The rest of the video is just Johnny maneuvering his wheel chair while the [Aphex Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex\_Twin) track "Afx237 v. 7" from the album [_Drukqs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drukqs) plays in the background. That is the band's logo in the top right corner of the card.&#x20;

UKIPEPE was created by the prolific artist known as "[ICQPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/artists/ICQPEPE)", creator of 28 Rare Pepe cards including the infamous Series 1, Card 49 - NOFAPPEPE. The women in the image is Rozanne Duncan, who was at the time was a UKIP member of the Thanet District Council in Kent, England. She was summarily dismissed after making derogatory statements about African Americans in a 2015 documentary entitled "Meet the Ukippers". Here is a story that mentions Duncan as well as a clip from the documentary which was posted on YouTube.
