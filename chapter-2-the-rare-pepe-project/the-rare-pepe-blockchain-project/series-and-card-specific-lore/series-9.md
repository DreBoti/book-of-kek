## Series 9, Card 4 - THEPEPE

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/S09 C04 - THEPEPE source and card (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Series 9, Card 4** - [THEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THEPEPE) was created by the prolific artist [Davinci9](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Davinci9) who has 21 cards in the Rare Pepe series along with several commissioned pieces. The bulk of Davinci9's Rare Pepe cards were consigned to RarePepeTrader in 2021 for ongoing sales, mainly through his WTH Auction House Telegram room.&#x20;

The image on the card is a parody of the American film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production logo that ran before all their movies and television cartoons. The lion in the film is named [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo\_the\_Lion\_\(MGM\)). Between 1917 and 1924, there were eleven different lions used for the logo. In 2021, MGM introduced a new CGI Logo which features a lion partially based on Leo.

**Series 9, Card 6 -** [**RUBBERPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RUBBERPEPE) was created by an unknown artist. The artist also created the cards [THEANCAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THEANCAPEPE), [STEALPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/STEALPEPE), [PPKING](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PPKING), [PREPEDATOR](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PREPEDATOR), and [SCORPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SCORPEPE). The card appears to be a hand drawn interpretation of the character Johnny played by [Chris Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris\_Cunningham) in the 2005 British experimental short film/music video [Rubber Johnny](https://youtu.be/eRvfxWRi6qQ) which was written, directed, and produced by Cunningham as well. In the opening scene, an off screen voice can be heard saying "do you want mama to come in?", which causes Johnny to throw a fit for which he is then given a sedative to calm him down. The rest of the video is just Johnny maneuvering his wheel chair while the [Aphex Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex\_Twin) track "Afx237 v. 7" from the album [_Drukqs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drukqs) plays in the background. That is the band's logo in the top right corner of the card.&#x20;
