**Series 2, Card 34** - [WINKELPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/WINKELPEPE) was created by the artist known as [DanDarkPill](https://pepe.wtf/artists/DanDarkPill). Mr. Pill created a total of 26 cards for the Rare Pepe project including the History of Art series and the Putin set. Originally minted as 2 assets, one was sent to a burn address just 5 days after it was issued making the card a 1 of 1. The card is currently in a dispenser and can be yours for the low low price of 89.9 BTC.

The card image is taken from the 1980 psychological horror film [The Shining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Shining\_\(film\)). The film is based on [Stephen King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen\_King)'s 1977 novel of the same name. At one point in the film, the child actor [Danny Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny\_Lloyd) is riding his [big wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big\_wheel\_\(tricycle\)) through the kitchen and down the staff quarters hallway of the Overlook Hotel. As he turns a corner he encounters [twin girls](https://twitter.com/Shining\_twins) wearing identical outfits and holding hands. Their only lines of dialog being "Hello Danny. Come and play with us. Come and play with us, Danny. For ever and ever and ever." &#x20;

On the heads of the twins, Mr. Pill pasted green versions of the twins [Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron\_Winklevoss) and [Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler\_Winklevoss) Winklevoss who claim to have had their idea for [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook) stolen by [Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\_Zuckerberg) while attending [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard\_University). The twins went on to found [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/) where they became the first Bitcoin Billionaires.&#x20;
