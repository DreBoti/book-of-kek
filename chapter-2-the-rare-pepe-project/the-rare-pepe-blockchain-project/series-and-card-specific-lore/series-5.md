The card is a parody of a 1793 painting entitled "_Portrait de l'artiste sous les traits d'un moqueur"_ by [Joseph Ducreux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph\_Ducreux). The painting one of several self-portraits of the artist.

OE translated the [original lyrics](https://genius.com/Eazy-e-boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics) "Crusin' down the street in my 6-4. Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough" into "Traversing down the boulevard in my 1764. Sequestering damsels, reprimanding Apostates."&#x20;
