# Rare Pepe Scientists

When the Rare Pepe Blockchain Project first started, a team of “meme scientists”, also called Rare Pepe Scientists, emerged to verify the dankness of the incoming tide of Rare Pepes into the project. As these cards were really dank, the group saw significant interest in adding them to a collection.

They made sure that each individual Rare Pepe was original, humane, and dank.

In a nutshell, a number of early innovators led by Joe Looney provided an opportunity for artists/individuals to submit ‘dank’ Pepes to be included in the Rare Pepe collection.

These crowdsourced submissions were reviewed with a light-touch approach to curating the collection — accepting those that were sufficiently ‘dank’ and were not offensive to the peace-loving values of the Rare Pepe community.

These Rare Pepes were tokenized onto the Bitcoin network using the [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io) Platform and were made available to be purchased through the user-friendly [RarePepeWallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/). Many of the Rare Pepe cards have imagery that draws on pop culture and provides cultural and/or political commentary (usually with much satire) regarding key historical moments.

After the 1774th Rare Pepe, the scientists declared the project closed, in order to maintain the scarcity and dankness of the entire project.
