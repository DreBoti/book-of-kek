# “The Rarest Book” by Eleonora Brizi

The Rarest Book by Eleonora Brizi is a physical directory of all 1774 original digital Rare Pepe NFTs and the first -ever collection assembling all Rare Pepes.

It contains images and stats for each card. Each of these cards in the original project were certified dank by a qualified Rare Pepe scientist. The book contains the thesis, cards and the most important parts, covering the entirety of the collection.

This book is one of a limited run of 300 total books that were ever printed, making it really dank and rare.

There is a Counterparty token associated with each book.

This book is a unique and rare artifact of Bitcoin history and digital blockchain artwork, and would make a great addition to any collection.

The book was launched during the conference On Art & Technology Organized by [New Art Academy](https://www.newartacademy.com/) in New York on October 24th 2018.

Considering the occasion, an auction of Rare Pepes was also hosted.

On October 25th 2018, a day after the conference, a pop up art show “Bushwick Generator”, in Brooklyn was hosted. Many of the Pepe community gathered to celebrate this amazing project of art on the blockchain and there was even a special guest: DJ PEPE.

Creative stations were organized for the visitors to make their own Pepes.
