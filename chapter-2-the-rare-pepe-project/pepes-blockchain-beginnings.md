# Pepe's Blockchain Beginnings

At the same time all of the Pepe controversy was happening over the years, there was a growing community of Pepe fans trying to reclaim the meme in their own way, **using blockchain technology**.

On crypto forums like [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/), people started creating pictures of Pepe, similar to collectible cards and tokenizing them on the blockchain.

Some Pepes were memes from 4chan, some were superhero knockoffs, some were even political Pepes.

They were named **Rare Pepes.**

These Rare Pepes would be traded amongst people, using cryptocurrency.

Soon, a platform for trading these collectibles, the “[RarePepeWallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/)”, was developed by [Joe Looney](https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf).

One user even managed to make a profit to buy a yacht which he named “[The SS Rare Pepe](https://www.vice.com/en/article/yw5axg/pepecash-millionaire-yacht-cryptocurrency-rare-pepes)”.\
The individual has lived on the yacht ever since.

Fun fact: The yacht was bought with [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH), one of the tokenized Rare Pepe cards.
