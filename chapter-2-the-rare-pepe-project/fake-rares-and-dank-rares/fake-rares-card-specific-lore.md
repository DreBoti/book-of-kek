# Fake Rares Card Specific Lore

Fun fact: The legend has it that the cards in Series 0 of the Fake Rares were submitted for approval to be a part of the Rare Pepe collection but were not approved. While not all of them were scientifically denied - the rule was that each card had to be an older XCP asset and not part of any directory.

Below you can find some more card specific lore:

![FAKEASF](<../../.gitbook/assets/fakerare-collab\_10 (1).gif>)

[FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) - Series 1, Card 1, 1/1,656&#x20;

The set begins with the [FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) community-created card. This asset was airdropped to the first 100 people in the Fake community and serves as the access card for submissions to the directory.



![FAKETORCH](../../.gitbook/assets/ifrwd90-4.gif)

[FAKETORCH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKETORCH) - Series 1, Card 2, 1/1

The FAKETORCH, another community-created cardâ€¦ and the only 1 of 1 card in the collection. The torch was designed to bounce from faker to faker each week,  granting the holder the privilege of adding a qualifying FAKE RARE into Series 0. This series is reserved for Rare Pepe-era fakes. Criteria outlined somewhere else.&#x20;



![PEPAAGOTCHI](../../.gitbook/assets/PEPAAGOTCHI.gif)

[PEPAAGOTCHI](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPAAGOTCHI) - Series 4, Card 46, 1/121

[@BabyPicasso](https://twitter.com/BabyPicassoo) and [@NftRooster](https://twitter.com/NftRooster) collaborated on [PEPAAGOTCHI](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPAAGOTCHI) as a tribute to [Aavegotchi's](https://www.aavegotchi.com/) by [Pixelcraft Studios](https://twitter.com/pixelcraftstuds) - a Play-2-Earn game on Polygon. Inspiration came from SARUTOBIPEPE which unlocked a special skin in the [Sarutobi](http://www.mandelduck.com/sarutobi/) game - the first playable Rare Pepe!



![MISSPEPEPUNK](../../.gitbook/assets/MISSPEPEPUNK.png)

[MISSPEPEPUNK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MISSPEPEPUNK) - Series 4, Card 43, 1/100

Fake version of [MISSPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MISSPEPE), a Rare Pepe submitted back in the day. Both cards were made and submitted by the same artist - [Ffmad](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Ffmad). This MISSPEPEPUNK is an NFT teacher, who is specialized in "green ones". For each of the 100 cards, a unique profile picture will be associated in the near future.



![PEPEFICATION](../../.gitbook/assets/PEPEFICATION.gif)

[PEPEFICATION](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEFICATION) - Series 7, Card 22, 1/75

From the [artist](https://twitter.com/Crims0nRIdeR), [Crimson Rider](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Crimson-Rider): "He's running from the 'Pepe Hype'. With each door he opens, he becomes more _frog_, and with every Pepe art he sees, he becomes more addicted until finally, he becomes filthy rich and falls into the 'well of wealth', where money loses any meaning and it's hard to feel anything. He breaks that crystal and reality becomes pointless, trapping himself in a never-ending circle."



![PEPONACID](../../.gitbook/assets/PEPONACID.gif)

[PEPONACID](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPONACID) - Series 4, Card 16, 1/30

The iconic frog has always been a symbol of love, positivity, and acceptance. What better way to showcase this acceptance than with a psychedelic twist. This Fake Rare represents the [artist's](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Prateek-Dhiman) love of psychedelics.&#x20;

![FAKEBANKSY](../../.gitbook/assets/FAKEBANKSY.gif)

[FAKEBANKSY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEBANKSY) - Series 2, Card 1, 1/100

From [Wizard X](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Wizard-X), the creator of the card: "On a long enough timeline, every shitcoin gets shredded."



![PEPEPOPO](../../.gitbook/assets/PEPEPOPO.gif)

[PEPEPOPO](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Wizard-X) - Series 3, Card 32, 1/21

[SeerLight](https://pepe.wtf/artists/SeerLight), the creator revealed how the idea of the card came to be: "I was showering and thought... What about a Pepe but make it Ghost in a Shell? Added a bit of vaporwave and tada!"
