# Fake Rares Submission Rules

First thing you need to do when creating your Fake Rare, is to create a Counterparty asset to associate with it.

To the non crypto-coin person this can be quite the learning task. To people already involved in Bitcoin it’s not that hard. Visit [this guide](https://github.com/robotlovecoffee/xcponboarding/wiki/Creator:-Onboarding-to-XCP-Freewallet-Desktop) to learn how to create an asset.

The cost to create an asset is .5 XCP (and a little bitcoin for the miner fee).

To submit to the Fake Rare Directory, you will need to DESTROY 1 FAKEASF. You can destroy the token by using the [Freewallet.io](http://freewallet.io/) app. Once approved your card will appear on [fakeraredirectory.com](http://fakeraredirectory.com/).

You can find the official submission rules [here](https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-submission-rules/).

### Submission Rules:

1. Fakes **must be 400 x 560**. They can look like trading cards and pay homage to RAREPEPEs, but this is not a requirement.
2. Please keep animated gif’s under 10MB in size. Use Compression. If you’d like to submit a mp4, consider using enhanced.cards to generate your JSON.&#x20;
3. Issuance must be **LOCKED**, so your Fake cannot be inflated.
4. **Your Fake must not be divisible**.
5. Your artwork should have something to do with Pepe.
6. Make sure your artwork doesn’t suck too bad.&#x20;
7. No NSFW content, please.
8. Your token must have somewhere between 21 and 10,000 issuances – See Above for details on Commons Issuance policy and burn requirement for cards wanting to release as a sub 21 issuance.
9. No websites or QR codes, please.
10. Only 1 submission per artist until approved or denied. If denied, you will be contacted via email.
11. Please be patient. It takes time to curate these exceptional fakes.&#x20;
12. Don’t distribute, sell or share your piece publicly before it is published in the directory.&#x20;

**NOTE:** **Please don’t destroy your FAKEASF until your card is ready and you are certain it will be approved.** Once your submission is accepted you will receive further instructions on the FAKEASF destroy. After the destroy is completed, you will receive confirmation via email once your submission is added to the directory.

### Submission Process:

1. Submit your fake to [Fakeasf.club](https://fakeasf.club/)
2. Email [fakepepeilluminati@protonmail.com](mailto:fakepepeilluminati@protonmail.com)
   * In the email include: Artist name, Image and XChain link
3. Wait for correspondence confirming your submission’s acceptance or rejection
