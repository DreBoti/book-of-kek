# Fake Commons

[Fake Commons](https://commons.fakeraredirectory.com/series/1/##) have been launched as a way to honor all submissions to the Fake Rare registry in some way.

Essentially, if you submit to Fake Rares, and get rejected, you will automatically receive an opportunity to burn 2100 PepeCash and submit to the Fake Commons instead.

This is a good route for new artists looking to mint/sell on XCP, and eventually work their way into Fake Rares.

### Fake Commons Submission Rules

You can find the official Fake Commons Submission rules [here](https://commons.fakeraredirectory.com/fake-commons-submissions/).

Your base card image (jpeg, png or gif) should be portrait and of 400X560 pixels in dimensions, your enhancements can explore other sizes, keeping ratio is nice for your enhancements but not essential – but should be followed if you would like to show your mp4 instead of the card in the directory for example.\
\
Your base card image should be under 10MB (squeezing something to that size is part of your art now) and you must always supply a base card image, even if your prefer media is the mp4 or Iframe URL. Your token description field should reference a JSON which also expresses the base image as the “image\_large” keys value.\

Reach out on the [telegram official channels](http://t.me/officialfakerares) if you need help.

Fill the [form](https://commons.fakeraredirectory.com/fake-commons-submissions/) with the details of your FAKE RARES submission. Please ensure that your card image is under 10MB - You upload your card image here only (referenced by 'image\_large' in your JSON), other media can be referenced via URL.\
