# Fake Rares & Dank Rares

In April of 2018 the rare pepe scientists retired and left us with years of pondering what the next step in evolution is for frogs and dankness in general. After all, many Pepes were left on the cutting room floor because they couldn’t get submitted in time (the Rare Pepe scientist backlog was long by the end), were rejected by scientists, or were just created pre - or post Rare Pepe, but still had some memetic appeal to them.

Which is why the [Fake Rare Directory](https://fakeraredirectory.wordpress.com/) and the [Dank Directory ](https://www.dankdirectory.io/)were created.

On the Fake Rare Directory it is clearly states that:

> _“Any asset created on XCP that was not approved by the Rare Pepe Scientists is considered a Fake Rare.” but also that “This directory is a curated, bourgeoise set of Fake Rares. No way in hell are we adding all 298375897597438957 Fake Rare ever created to this directory play.”_

[Joe Looney](https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf), the creator of the [RarePepeWallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/), also created the [FakeRareWallet](https://fakerarewallet.com/), for the purposes of the Fake Rare Pepe movement.

The wallet’s website properly displays all Fake Rare Pepes the user has in their possession (even if they’re animated, which is a nice touch), which isn’t the case with RarePepeWallet, as it only properly displays the original Rare Pepes.

With the resurrection of XCP users, creators, collectors, and the newfound interest in Bitcoin NFTs and collectibles, some users found it important to make sure more _dankness_ can be preserved in a semi-tribute and spin-off to Rare Pepe Trading.

The [Fake Rare Pepe movement](https://fakeraredirectory.com/about/) started in 2021 when some of the original Rare Pepe artists started giving out unofficial fakes and rejected Rare Pepes that never made the cut.

The first card was [FAKEASF](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FAKEASF) and was given out in batches of 20 to the community.
