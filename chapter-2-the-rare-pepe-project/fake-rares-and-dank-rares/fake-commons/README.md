# Fake Commons

[Fake Commons](https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-commons/) is the experimental arm of [Fake Rares](../), built on top of the fake ecosystem to further encapsulate the culture and community. This collection is a playground for artists to push creative boundaries, test distribution strategies, and explore with ultimate freedom. By design, Commons have less structure, fewer rules and a lower barrier to entry, and like Fake Rares, they pay homage to [Rare Pepes](../../the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/).&#x20;

Fake Commons require the sacrifice of a little [PEPECASH ](../../../chapter-3-blockchain-counterparty-how-to/what-is-pepecash.md)(currently 2100, though subject to change if the PEPECASH market pumps wildly), and for the most part, seem to function more like trading cards... these details are reflective of Rare Pepes and interject a bit of that spirit back into the community.

Ultimately, Fake Commons are a means to expand and enhance what the community is building within Fake Rares, all on top of the foundation of Rare Pepes. This is a good route for new artists looking to mint/sell on XCP, and eventually work their way into Fake Rares.
