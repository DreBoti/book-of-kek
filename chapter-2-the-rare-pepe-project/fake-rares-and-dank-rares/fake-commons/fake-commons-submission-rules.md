# Fake Commons Submission Rules

**You can find the official Fake Commons Submission rules** [**here**](https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-submission-rules/)**.**

First thing you need to do when creating your Fake **Common**, is to create a [Counterparty](../../../chapter-3-blockchain-counterparty-how-to/counterparty-what-is-it/) asset to associate with it.

To the non crypto-coin person this can be quite the learning task. To people already involved in Bitcoin it’s not that hard. Visit [this guide](https://github.com/robotlovecoffee/xcponboarding/wiki/Creator:-Onboarding-to-XCP-Freewallet-Desktop) to learn how to create an asset.

The cost to create an asset is 0.5 XCP (and a little bitcoin for the miner fee).

Use the [Fake Commons Submission Portal](https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-submissions/) and fill out the form with the details of your FAKE COMMON submission. Please ensure that your card image is under 10MB - here you upload your card image only (referenced by 'image\_large' in your JSON), other media can be referenced via URL.

To submit to the Fake Commons Directory, and as an ode to our forefrog-fathers, you will need to destroy a minimum of 2,100 [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH). You can destroy the token by using the [Freewallet.io](http://freewallet.io/) app. Please do not destroy anything until your card has been approved… no refunds.

Once approved your card will appear on [fakeraredirectory.com](https://fakeraredirectory.com/fake-commons/), and [pepe.wtf](https://pepe.wtf/new/collections/Fake-Rares)… and probably all over Twitter. Don’t feel compelled to DM the team to check on the status. Persistence is key in many things… but here it will only distract and delay.

### **Format Rules**

Similar to Fake Rares, your base card image (jpeg, png or gif) should be portrait and of 400X560 pixels in dimensions, your enhancements can explore other sizes, keeping ratio is nice for your enhancements but not essential – but should be followed if you would like to show your mp4 instead of the card in the directory for example.\
\
Your base card image should be under 10MB (squeezing something to that size is part of your art now) and you must always supply a base card image, even if your prefer media is the mp4 or Iframe URL. Your token description field should reference a JSON which also expresses the base image as the “image\_large” keys value.
