# How to create an Emblem Vault

### Step 1: Get some $COVAL

The amount of $COVAL tokens needed to pay for the process varies according to the price of $COVAL. Currently it’s 30 $COVAL tokens.

Getting them is easy, go to [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) and swap some $ETH for $COVAL (an alternative would be to use Polygon’s PoS chain to save on gas fees).

Polygon - 0x4597c8a59ab28b36840b82b3a674994a279593d0

Binance Smart Chain - 0xd15cee1deafbad6c0b3fd7489677cc102b141464

Fantom - 0x8b8407c6184f1f0fd1082e83d6a3b8349caced12

### Step 2: Go to Emblem.finance

Go to [https://emblem.finance/](https://emblem.finance/) and click “Create”.

You will need to connect your Metamask wallet and approve the spending of $COVAL tokens before you are able to mint the vault.

You will be guided through this process on the Emblem.Finance website. Also, remember to have some $ETH to pay for the gas fees.

Note: Make the vault “public” when setting it up, otherwise the contents and addresses of the Vault will be hidden and only revealed by a password.
{% endhint %}

### Step 3: Approve and mint

After you fill in all of the necessary information and make your Vault public, you are ready to mint it. Sign the transaction (which will cost a bit of $ETH).

Viola! Your vault is created! Now we need to put our tokens in it.

### Step 4: Put BTC tokens (NFTs) in the vault

Once your vault is created, you will see a “Put BTC In” tab. Click it.

You will be shown a unique Bitcoin address dedicated to your Emblem vault. Now you can send your Rare Pepes to that address on the bitcoin blockchain.

Done! You created your Emblem Vault and filled it with the desired Rare Pepe/s. Now you can list it on marketplaces like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/).
