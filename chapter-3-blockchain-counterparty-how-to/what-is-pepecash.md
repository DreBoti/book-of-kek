# What is PEPECASH?

What would a world of Rare Pepes be without it’s own blockchain based currency? No worries, the community has that problem solved as well. [PEPECASH is the currency of Pepes](http://rarepepedirectory.com/?p=65), and can be used to pay for new submissions to get your Rare Pepes into [rarepepedirectory.com](http://rarepepedirectory.com) and into the wallets to speculate with or to be used in p2p transactions.

With the token locked at 1 billion shares of PEPECASH, it lacks the inflationary aspect of a currency like dogecoin, while still maintaining the same meme-friendly madness. Each week half of the earnings from submissions is sacrificed to Kek for good luck, which makes PepeCash deflationary.

PepeCash is a card just like the other cards on the [rarepepedirectory.com](http://rarepepedirectory.com), except it is a lot more liquid. Some people are also working on games that use PepeCash.

There were 1 billion Pepe Cash tokens issued.

As of February 2022, 303.6 million or 30.36% of Pepe Cash has been sent to a burn address (1BurnPepexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAK33R).
