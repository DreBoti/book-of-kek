# 6. Increase Supply

If you have not locked the Token supply, you can issue more tokens. For example, you would want to do this if you created only 1 Token to start but wanted the supply to be 100.

### Step 1:

Go to: [https://coindaddy.counterwallet.io/](https://coindaddy.counterwallet.io/) and log in with your 12-word passphrase.

### Step 2:

Select the small arrow dropdown on the Token you have created and select "Issue Additional"

Enter the amount you want to issue in the "Additional Qty" field.

To get to 100, in our case, you would enter 99.

Select and click "Issue Additional".
