### **Step 4:**

Transfer BTC into this account.

You need to send some BTC to your new wallet to start. Single click on the first address string itself to select it, then copy that address, which you can then use to send BTC funds to.

{% hint style="info" %}
To send BTC from an on-ramp, you can for example use Coinbase, or use a DEX and trade ETH for BTC, for instance using [https://simpleswap.io/](https://simpleswap.io/) or [https://dex-trade.com/](https://dex-trade.com/). You could start with $50 worth of BTC.

All transactions on XCP have a small BTC tx fee (like eth gas).
