# 7. Lock Supply

Once you are sure of the number of tokens you want available, you will lock the supply.

Doing this will create a limited number. So it could be a 1/1, 1/69 1/100.

### Step 1:

Go to: [https://coindaddy.counterwallet.io/](https://coindaddy.counterwallet.io/) and log in with your 12-word passphrase.

### Step 2:

Select the small arrow dropdown on the Token you have created and select "Lock Token Issuance."
