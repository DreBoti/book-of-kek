# 8. Submit To Directories

Many creators will create cards hoping that they will be accepted to the Fake Rare Directory or the Dank Directory. If you are one of these, you will want to ensure your media assets are in the correct format for approval.

By making one asset, you can submit to Fake Rares, and if not accepted, then try and see if Dank will accept.

Required specs:

* Listing Directory Image: 400×560 image or GIF\
  This is the image that will be shown in the directory. If you are making a large file for your asset, you will need to make a different display image for the directory.
* NFT Media Asset:\
  Your ASSET IMAGE can be a varying size if needed, 800×1120, 600×840, etc. Or MP4 via your JSON file that you created with EasyAsset.

## Dank Rares

### Step 1:

Go to [https://dankdirectory.wordpress.com/](https://dankdirectory.wordpress.com/) and click the “Submit” button.

### Step 2:

Fill out the form:

* Artist: Your Artist Name
* Transaction Hash: tx link showing you burned/destroyed Dank Meme Cash
* Image Link: Link to the Listing page image that is 400×560
* Email: Your contact email
* Asset Link: Link to XChain of the Token you created

Note: You will need to burn a DANKMEMECASH card to be able to submit it to the Dank Directory. At the moment, this costs about USD 100 from the cheapest Dispenser. However, if you ask around, you might be able to get one for free. If not, just factor this as a promotional cost to have your work listed on the directory.
