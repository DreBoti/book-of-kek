# How to buy Rare Pepes

#### **Step 1:**

Go to [Rare Pepe Wallet](https://rarepepewallet.com)**.**

A new account will be created for you with corresponding 12 word seed phrase:

#### Step 2:

**Save the seed phrase** (write it on a piece of paper, place it in a safe place) and continue.

You will now have a BTC address attached to your Rare Pepe Wallet:

#### Step 3:

Deposit BTC to this address (there are multiple ways to do this).

If you do not have BTC, you can go to [SimpleSwap](https://simpleswap.io/) for example, enter destination address as your Pepe address, and send the corresponding funds.

**At this point there are several ways to buy a Rare Pepe:**

## **Option 1: Using a dispenser on** [**Xchain.io**](https://xchain.io/)

This process involves sending BTC directly to a dispenser address and the card will automatically be sent to you (very similar to a smart contract on Ethereum).

### **Steps:**

To find a card you wish to purchase, a great resource is [Pepe.wtf](https://pepe.wtf/)

Once you have located a card you wish to purchase, you will be linked to the asset page on Xchain. Below is an example of an asset page:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/wPCTvK1HXKUkDvLy4uSnkpQzjvzRk09VLz\_u-XtxWI0Sb4n0EcAK9N3MO3qJSUPf2cAEnyI2pkSvp\_PonGasnVzypwVR77\_9uCvh0WNVsUBT2Hdl86FDw\_5A2mnxi3JGFhaOaf-h)

When you open an asset page, the default tab is ‘Information’. To see available dispensers, click on the ‘Dispensers’ tab. Below is an example of a Dispensers tab:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/G4AVgCntZNVjAjuJAfT8YpwBLvNpqOAZxqLXXFyLnp3LtEu-YxTJzSCRLoONbKXq72pMFQ4fsrHQLJxSNOrt3L9Y-N5wg4dqeOR0VnaP3iEgKG6wKa27RH0XhjWh273IspSxnYV4)

From here click on the green ‘view’ box. The page will display as follows:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/uecn63ApnuXpuQvjXSrq0FKnjZcDUoKz1Iw9Wn0KtFA4bLkRlhVak3Lcgz1C4jMwPcWWtyM5-14Fo-VPM0X4VLHssfIX-ulrB4ruKEmhbS01d8y2yPS3xhq5wT8UsXG8SKR3kl4b)

Critical information on this page is the ‘**Give Remaining**’ quantity, the ‘**Satoshi Rate**’, and the **Bitcoin address**.

If you were to open a page with a dispenser that has been exhausted it will display red on the right panel as shown below:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Kip0f8BVR3goZMP6lP4J6B3tOep8vYNXjPrsEzv9AjXGhcFOqHb4OviX-y20bPgth2g1NKOi5aXCL9MR38PZ3e1iKDtUMfC9I3Y4dNgfMo\_aGrOwSmuG70LDiem0aIb36vwkL9el)

Above you see that the ‘Give Remaining’ is 0. **Do not send funds to this dispenser.**

In the first example, the ‘Give Remaining’ is 2, meaning there are 2 available.

In order to obtain one of these assets, simply send the ‘Satoshi Rate’ to the address provided.

To do this through Rare Pepe Wallet select the currency icon in the top right corner:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wF41EkQAHdUKo-VEvL4mJ\_9sR9yRF2M\_we060j66wEHMA74e4nil7DcNsYYJ5LYYRZVckYucz3XG24QqU1DV6F6lOK9dNk12\_prBgYVhc11IDddBTseFkccgvALHnRzxDohQlG5f)

Click on the Bitcoin Icon and you will be presented with the Send BTC screen:

Fill in the Dispensers BTC Address and corresponding Satoshi Rate and voila, after 1 block confirmation (<10 min) you will be the proud new owner of a Rare Pepe Card.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Keep in mind that someone sending an identical transaction before you will result in the dispenser having 0 tokens left to give. If this happens, your only option is to try and find the dispenser owner to get your BTC back.

That being said, consider using dispensers that have more than 1 token left in them.
{% endhint %}

## **Option 2: Using XCP/PEPECASH on** [**Rare Pepe Wallet**](https://rarepepewallet.com)

This option requires you to acquire XCP (easily done through a dispenser on [XChain](http://xchain.io/dispensers)) and then find a sell order on Rare Pepe Wallet.

### Steps:

This method relies on everything we just learned in Option 1. But instead of acquiring an RPC, we will be acquiring a currency known as [XCP](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/counterparty).

Bring up the [XCP asset page](https://xchain.io/asset/XCP) and find a dispenser with some XCP to give:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TX79xwUKPF5Xk5YDheGYfo\_4LooZGdHetV3iFXv2DS3bqTMY-ST6zfDxXaWlH63oMPSdjSTm6MebQ4Z6X0dZqEroqv0O43NLKYTJtag7vgDrnvT4UewbgwiO14k4msiJmzzKfHiG)

Once you’ve acquired some XCP, you will see the balance (in red) on your [Rare Pepe Wallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/) under the currency icon:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wF41EkQAHdUKo-VEvL4mJ\_9sR9yRF2M\_we060j66wEHMA74e4nil7DcNsYYJ5LYYRZVckYucz3XG24QqU1DV6F6lOK9dNk12\_prBgYVhc11IDddBTseFkccgvALHnRzxDohQlG5f)

Click on the front of an RPC to turn it over:

![Uncle Pepe back](<../../.gitbook/assets/uncle pepe back.png>) ![Uncle Pepe front](<../../.gitbook/assets/uncle pepe.png>)

Click on Buy/Sell with XCP to bring up the card’s order book:

Click on the order you wish to interact with to bring up the buy screen:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xj5WbodKLE-gRDoOoBjnHMyxTKz5zaxOm49WxhZ4cMxvkILnfryVvlXSMYUOjWqOHO2Pgcx\_z0QJdotffc88JXPLmJjo5FW0Rl3jqIzL3sN4FQ3CuyqwJh6pk-0OrBbArsJyijBe)

Preview order and buy the card. DONE.

## **Option 3 : Create a buy order on** [**Rare Pepe Wallet**](https://rarepepewallet.com) **in hopes a seller fulfills it.**

To do this, using step e. (Option 2), where we brought up the card’s order book, scroll down to find the sell option:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RmfrQyrLJtmhlukd28ZSrJhNiSGhGN4WFIbOtch8jdUAB1aFsQ5S6iUbcls4bhe7bCdMEDyP38ce-gGF1I25X0dMIdRNhwTERqpMHWIAL0d-zYEzWHC9eLo0nw2X\_pX4\_2634wiK)

Click on the yellow Sell Card tab to bring up the Sell Screen:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6AcYn\_2FBWXYK1goOIsvfZ\_-jXu\_1Iptub83Vpm5O7KmhWbsvXfrF\_5noCK5wsqBlFLDihATNAF1a\_ekkhcEAreU-YmMPWm0jFxQA\_JGsrU6FwWNORwgwB5bav8mE0vUv8GlL08c)

Fill out the amount to sell, your chosen XCP price, preview order and BAM, you’ve created a buy order, which should appear on the Buy Orders section of the Order Book. Wait for a seller to complete your buy.
