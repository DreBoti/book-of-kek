# Birth of The Meme

Furie started posting his comics to his MySpace blog (voluntarily deleted since then) in a long series of posts surrounding the Boy's Club characters.

Fans of the **Boy’s Club** comic also began uploading Furie's work online.

One particular comic gained a lot of attention. In it, Pepe pulls his pants all the way down to pee and is spotted by his comic book buddy. Later when questioned about the weird habit by Landwolf he responds with: "**Feels good, man."**

The “Feels good man” comics’ origin actually has a hilarious background story behind it. It was created one evening at his partner’s apartment.

> _“He said, '' Can you stand over there and kind of make it look like you’re pulling your pants down while you’re bending over so I can draw you?” So yea, that was my butt… and my toilet”_ - Aiyana

Matt said that the inspiration for this bathroom scene actually came from his own life.

> _“When I was younger, me and my cousin David would go to the same school and whenever he would go to the public bathroom he would pull his pants all the way down to pee. Underwear and everything. It seemed like it would feel really good.”_ - Matt

Shortly after, the phrase “feels good man” started to gain traction online.

Members of bodybuilding communities often used the phrase to express their fitness achievements. It didn’t take long for various photos with “feels good man” text in them to start popping online. Cats, dogs, people, everything.

Matt would constantly receive emails from people showcasing Pepe's face and the “feels good man” phrase next to it, from different parts of the internet.

One user even made a [“Feels good Man” song](https://youtu.be/twCdhUYb1As) back then.

> _“It was like this big, nerdy thing.”_ - Matt

This was both the start of Pepe's "meme career" and the first time Matt actually heard of the term “meme” and got familiar with it.

Throughout 2008, Pepe was mostly associated with the "Feels Good Man" reaction image.

On February 4th, “Something Awful” contributor Jon Hendren (a.k.a. @fart) posted the "Feels Good Man" comic to 4chan. In March 2009, the “feels good man” meme even got [recognized](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Feels%20Good%20Man) by Urban Dictionary.
